<p class="h2">PREFACE</p>

<p class="indent">Japan is a paradise of flowers and of treasure-flowers,
as the Japanese mothers call their babies.
In no other country in the world do they both form
so large a part of the daily life of the people. From
the first white plum blossom to the last gorgeous
chrysanthemum the path of the days is strewn
with beautiful blossoms; and from the time of the
Dolls' Festival to the New Year's Celebration there
is a constant round of simple pleasures for the children.</p>

<p class="indent">Happy children! who are always laughing and
never crying; who are taught filial respect, reverence,
and unquestioning obedience, but are surrounded
in their homes with an atmosphere of kindness,
cheerfulness and loving care.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that the New Japan is very different
from the Old. Railway trains and electric cars are
taking the place of the jinrikisha and kago; modern
school-houses, with desks, chairs, blackboards, and
the latest methods of teaching are fast replacing the
tiny school-room with its matted floors and its lessons
learned by rote. But the spirit of the common
people is unchanged. The children play the
same games and listen to the same delightful tales;
and their fathers and mothers hold to their old
superstitions, their ancestor-worship and their love
of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">This story is a picture of the simple life of a
Japanese family. To follow little Umé San through
the year, to play with her dolls on the days of the
Dolls' Festival, to go with her to the parks to admire
the cherry blossoms or chrysanthemums and
join the crowds who are celebrating these joyous
seasons, to feed the goldfishes and doves in the
temple gardens, to buy toys and gifts in the streets
of shops, and to welcome the New Year with
festivity and merrymaking, is to catch a glimpse
of the rare charm and spirit that pervade life in
this &quot;Land of the Rising Sun.&quot;</p>

<h1>UMÉ SAN IN JAPAN</h1>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h3">LITTLE MISS PLUM BLOSSOM</p>

<p class="indent">The little plum tree in the garden had blossomed
regularly every year for ten years on the twentieth
day of the second month. That day was Plum
Blossom's birthday.</p>

<p class="indent">On the day that she was born the little plum
tree had blossomed for the first time. For that
reason she was called Umé, which is the Japanese
word for &quot;plum blossom&quot;; and for her sake the
tree had opened its first blossoms on that same day
for the next nine years.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, on the day before her eleventh birthday,
all the buds were closed hard and fast. Umé
looked at them just before going to bed and there
seemed no chance of their opening for several
days.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps the weather will be fine to-morrow,
Umé-ko,&quot; said her mother, as she spread a wadded
quilt on the floor for her little daughter's bed.
&quot;If it is, and the sun shines honorably bright,
the buds may open before the hour of sunset.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
&quot;I will say a prayer to Benten Sama that it may
be so,&quot; answered Umé. Benten Sama is the Japanese
goddess of good fortune, to whom the little
girl prayed very often.</p>

<p class="indent">She knelt upon the mat and bent down until her
forehead touched the floor, after the Japanese manner
of making an honorable bow. She clapped her
hands softly three times, and then rubbed one little
pink palm against the other while she prayed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Benten Sama,&quot; she said, &quot;grant that just
one little spray of the plum blossoms may open
to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she was very still, and then she
added, &quot;If they are open when I first wake in the
morning, I will honorably practise on my koto for
one whole hour after breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then little Umé Utsuki slipped into her bed upon
the floor, laid her head on the thin cushion of her
wooden pillow, and drew the soft puff under her
cunning Japanese chin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night, dear Benten Sama,&quot; she whispered
softly, and fell asleep with the words of an old
Japanese song on her drowsy tongue:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;Evening burning!</span><br />
<span class="i4">Little burning!</span><br />
<span class="i2">Weather, be fair to-morrow!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The buds on the plum tree outside were closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
hard and fast, and the house walls about Umé were
also tightly closed. The bright moon in the heavens
could find no chink through which to send a cheering
ray to little Umé San.</p>

<p class="indent">All through the night the frost sparkled on the
bare twigs of the dwarf trees in the garden. All
through the night the plum tree stood still and
made no sign that Benten Sama had heard Umé's
prayer. When the moonbeams grew pale in the
morning light the buds were still tightly closed.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé stirred in her bed on the floor, crept softly
to the screen in the wall and pushed it open. She
moved the outer shutter also along its groove and
stepped off the veranda without even stopping to
put on her white stockings or her little wooden
clogs.</p>

<p class="indent">Down the garden path to the plum tree she pattered
as fast as her bare feet could carry her.</p>

<p class="indent">Alas, there was nothing to be seen on her plum
tree but brown buds!</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up into the gray morning sky and
tried to think of something else; but her gay little
kimono covered a heart that was heavy with disappointment.</p>

<p class="indent">The tears tried to force their slow way into her
eyes, but the little girl blinked them back again.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's ten years had been spent in learning the
hard lesson of bearing disappointments cheerfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Now, with the shadow of tears filling her eyes, she
tried to bring the shadow of a smile to her tiny
mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Benten Sama did not honorably please to open
the buds,&quot; she whispered with a sob.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, standing on the frosty ground, with her
bare toes numb from the cold, Umé made a rebellious
little resolve deep in her heart where she
thought Benten Sama would know nothing about it.</p>

<p class="indent">She resolved not to practise on her koto at all
after breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">There were two reasons for making the resolve
so secretly. She might wish to pray to Benten
Sama again some time, although if the goddess
were not going to answer her prayers it did not
seem at all likely; and besides, it was being very
disobedient, because it was the rule that she must
practise one-half hour every morning after breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she realized that her disobedience would
hurt her mother, who was not at all to blame because
the plum tree had not blossomed; but just
as her resolution began to weaken, her mother
came out upon the veranda and called to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The plum branch which your august father
brought home only a week ago is full of blossoms,&quot;
she said, as she led the child back into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">It was true. In a beautiful vase on the floor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
the honorable alcove stood a spray of white plum
blossoms. Umé's mother pushed the sliding walls
of the room wide open so that the morning sun
might shine full upon the flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl ran across the matted floor and
knelt joyously before them. &quot;They are most honorably
welcome!&quot; she cried, and bent her forehead
to the floor in salutation.</p>

<p class="indent">She forgot at once her disappointment in the
garden and her resolve not to practise. She touched
the sweet blossoms with loving fingers and called
her brother to look at the beautiful things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come Tara San! Come and look at the eldest
brother of a hundred flowers!&quot; she called.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only Tara, her brother, but Yuki, her baby
sister, also came to bend over the blossoms in delight.</p>

<p class="indent">The spray stood in a brown jar filled with moist
earth; here and there the brown color of the jar
was flecked with drifts of white to represent the
snow on bare earth, and the branch looked like a
tiny tree growing out of the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">The plum is the first of all the trees to blossom
in Japan, and for that reason it is called &quot;eldest
brother&quot; to the flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">While the children touched the blossoms gently
and chattered their delight, their mother was busy,
waking the servants, sliding back all the wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
shutters of the house, folding the bedding and putting
it away in the closets.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé left her flower-gazing and sprang to her own
puffs before her mother could touch them. &quot;I will
put them away,&quot; she said, and folded them carefully
as she had been taught to do. After breakfast they
would have to be taken out and aired; but the room
must first be put in order for the morning meal.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's bed was made, as are all Japanese beds,
by spreading a quilted puff upon the floor. With
another puff over her, and a wooden block on which
to rest her head, the little girl slept as comfortably
as most people sleep on mattresses and soft pillows.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé laughed softly now as she folded the puffs
away in their closet. &quot;There are still many things
to make my birthday a happy one,&quot; she said to herself.
&quot;There will be a game with Cousin Tei
after breakfast, and perhaps she will give me a
gift.&quot; She said the last words in a whisper, so
that her mother would not hear. No matter how
much she might long for a gift, it was not becoming
in her to speak of it beforehand.</p>

<p class="indent">She was sure that there would be gifts from
her father and mother and from the respected
grandmother. That was to be expected, and had
even been hinted. The grandmother had mentioned
an envelope of paper handkerchiefs the very day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
before, after Umé had made an unusually graceful
bow to her.</p>

<p class="indent">In her heart Umé wanted most a pair of little
American shoes, but she had never dared to ask
for them because her father did not like the dress
of the American women. In fact, he often told
Umé to observe carefully how much more graceful
and attractive the kimono is than the strange clothing
worn by the foreign people.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl sighed as she remembered it. Just
then she heard her father's step in the next room
and turned quickly to bow before him.</p>

<p class="indent">The maids had brought several lacquered trays
into the room, one for each member of the family,
and had set them near together on the floor. Each
tray had short legs, three or four inches high, and
looked like a toy table. On the tray was placed a
pair of chopsticks, a dainty china bowl and a tiny
cup. Now one maid was beginning to fill the
bowls with boiled rice and another was pouring tea
into the cups.</p>

<p class="indent">All three children remained standing until the
father entered the room. Then each one, even
Baby San, bowed before him, kneeling on the floor
and touching his forehead to the mat and saying,
&quot;Good morning, honorable Father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To their mother the children bowed in the same
way, and also to their grandmother when she came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
into the room. Everything would have been most
quiet and proper but for the baby. She liked to
bump her little forehead on the floor so well that
she kept on kotowing to old black Tama, the tailless
cat, who stalked into the room. As if that were not
enough, she bowed to each one of the breakfast
trays until her mother seated her before one of them
and gave her a pair of tiny chopsticks.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there was the waiting until the grandmother
and the father and mother were served, which
seemed to the baby to take too long a time. She
beat the tray with her chopsticks and called for the
rice-cakes even as they were disappearing down
the honorable throat of her father.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara laughed. He was very fond of his little
sister. That she should do such an unheard-of
thing as to demand cakes from her father seemed
to him exceedingly funny. His father smiled, too.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your grandmother will have a task to teach you
what is proper, Yuki San,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the breakfast of rice, tea and raw fish
was over. The little lacquer trays were all taken
out of the room, and the father was ready to go to
his silk shop.</p>

<p class="indent">His jinrikisha was waiting at the garden gate.
In their place on the flat stone at the house entrance
stood his wooden clogs, and all the family gathered
at the door to bid him &quot;Sayonara.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h3">UMÉ'S BIRTHDAY</p>

<p class="indent">Umé stood still, looking after her father until
his jinrikisha was out of sight.</p>

<p class="indent">Down in her heart there was an uneasy feeling
that she was going to do wrong. She had resolved
to omit her koto practice, and having made such a
resolve it seemed to her as binding as a promise.
But now was the time she had always given to her
practice; now, when her mother was busy with
household cares.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will go first to cousin Tei's,&quot; she said to herself,
and ran to her grandmother's room to find
her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Haha San,&quot; she said, &quot;may I have your
honorable permission to go to cousin Tei's house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Daughter,&quot; answered her mother, and went
on matching the silk pieces of the grandmother's
new kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé stepped down from the veranda into the
garden path; then she stopped and looked back
into the room where her koto lay. Something
within her told her to go back. It was the strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
sense of obedience to duty which makes such a large
part of the life of every Japanese girl.</p>

<p class="indent">She felt it so strongly that she took one step
backward. Then the resolve made in the early
morning, when she was disappointed at not seeing
the plum blossoms, flashed into her memory. She
slipped her feet into her wooden clogs, turned
toward the garden and clattered swiftly down the
path.</p>

<p class="indent">All the flowering shrubs were still wrapped in
their winter kimonos of straw and it seemed to
Umé that they knew about her disobedience. The
cherry trees and the dwarf pine trees waved their
branches backward toward the house.</p>

<p class="indent">She passed the little hill, the pond with its bridge,
and the stone lantern, and she remembered that one
day her father had told her that they all stood for
obedience. But she ran forward, shaking her
naughty little head as if to shake away every good
influence.</p>

<p class="indent">At the farther end of the garden a tiny gateway
led into her cousin Tei's garden, through which
she ran to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Tei was standing on the veranda bouncing a ball.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Tei,&quot; said Umé. &quot;Let us go to the
street of shops and buy some sweets. It is my
birthday and I have ten sen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tei was so much in the habit of obeying that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
obeyed Umé, and the two little girls went into the
city streets, where they found so many things to
interest them that Umé quite forgot her koto practice.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not a common thing for the two children
to wander away in this manner. They had so many
playthings and so much room in the two gardens
that they were quite contented to play together
at home all day long after they had finished their
house duties and the lessons at school were over.</p>

<p class="indent">Today the children were to have a holiday; and
while Umé's mother thought she was at Tei's house,
Tei's mother thought her little daughter was at her
cousin Umé's.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the middle of the afternoon before the two
little girls returned home. They went first to the
street of toy-shops and Umé bought a big red ball
and a fairy-story book full of the most delightful
pictures.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they sat down on the temple steps to look
at the pictures, and would have read the story, too,
but in a moment a man came down the street with
a crowd of merry children following him. He
stopped in front of Umé and quickly made five or
six butterflies out of pieces of colored paper he
took from his sleeve pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">The man blew the butterflies up into the air and
kept them flying about by waving a big fan. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
last he made a beautiful yellow one light on Tei's
hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep it,&quot; said Umé, &quot;it will bring good luck,&quot;
and she gave the man a rin for it.</p>

<p class="indent">At one of the booths near the temple she bought
two baked sweet potatoes and some rice-cakes,
and the little girls ate their luncheon, holding the
crumbs for the pigeons that flew down to eat from
their outstretched hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the sen were all spent; but there were still
many pleasant things for the two little girls to do.
They ran down to the pond in the temple garden
to look at the goldfish. Then they played a game
with the new ball, and watched a group of boys
playing marbles. They even played blind-man's-buff
with some of the other children, and were
really very happy.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Perhaps they would not have thought to go home
at all if Umé had not remembered the tea-party
in honor of her birthday. Her father was to come
home from his shop earlier than usual, so that
the family might drink tea together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Tei,&quot; she said at last, &quot;it is nearly the
hour of tea-drinking. Let us go home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Obedient Tei turned at once, saying only, &quot;It
would have been good to read the fairy story in
the picture-book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé had not heard what Tei said. For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
first time in many hours she was thinking of the
koto practice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever do anything disobedient, Tei?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Tei thought very hard for a few moments.
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said at last, &quot;I once put the cherry
blossoms into the chrysanthemum vase when the
honorable mother told me not to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked at Tei in surprise. &quot;But how could
you?&quot; she asked. &quot;They must have hurt your
intelligent eyes after you put them there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tei shook her head. &quot;I thought they looked
pretty,&quot; she confessed.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked doubtful. After a moment she said,
&quot;I could never have put them in that vase; it would
have looked wrong from the first. But I ran away
from my koto practice to-day, perhaps that was
just as bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Tei's turn to look surprised. &quot;How
could you do it?&quot; she asked in horror. &quot;All the
gods will talk about you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé shook her head. &quot;It was not hard to do
it,&quot; she said, &quot;and it is true that I have not thought
about it in this whole beautiful day. I do not understand
why.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is because there have been so many other
things to think about,&quot; said Tei; but she went
home and told her mother that she thought Umé
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
would feel the displeasure of the gods because of
her disobedience.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Umé, she said nothing about it at first.
Her father was at home and the little girl slipped
out of her clogs and into the room like a gay
butterfly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have returned, honorable Father,&quot; she said,
fluttering to her knees and spreading her kimono
sleeves as widely as they would go above her head.
At the same time she bobbed the saucy little head
upon a mat. Once would have been quite enough,
but Umé did it several times.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will do,&quot; said her father at last.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw that the child was excited. Umé's grandmother
saw it also and spoke reprovingly. &quot;Little
girls should never behave in a way to draw the
honorable eyes of their parents upon them in displeasure,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé had discovered the tray of gifts standing
on the floor. There were several packages,
each neatly wrapped in white paper with a bit of
writing on it, and tied with red and white paper
ribbons.</p>

<p class="indent">Before she touched them Umé made a deep bow
before her grandmother, saying, &quot;Truly, thanks!&quot;
Then to her father she said, &quot;O Chichi San, have
I your generous permission to open the packages?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The permission was given and happy little Umé
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
knelt on the floor beside the tray and opened one
package after another. From every one she took
first a tiny piece of dried fish wrapped in colored
paper, which is nearly always given with a present
in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are for good luck,&quot; she said, and placed
the bits of fish carefully in a little lacquered box.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course there was the envelope of paper handkerchiefs
from her grandmother. There was also
a beautiful new kimono from her mother, and from
her father there was a hairpin with white plum
blossoms for ornament.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara gave her a doll dressed in a kimono like
her own new one. &quot;I kept it in the godown for
a whole week of days,&quot; he told her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the mother softly, &quot;and it was not
very hard to make such a small kimono secretly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall call her Haru,&quot; said Umé, &quot;because she
has come to me in the first days of the honorable
springtime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the day that I brought the hairpin home and
hid it in your mother's sleeve,&quot; said her father with
a smile, &quot;I felt deeply deceitful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Umé felt very unhappy. She looked at
all the loving faces and remembered that she, too,
had this very day been most deceitful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now let us look at Umé's plum tree,&quot; said the
grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
All the family rose from the floor and followed
the good father into the garden. Yuki San toddled
along on her wooden clogs, and behind the baby
marched tailless Tama, keeping a sharp eye on the
baby's hands. Tama did not like the feeling of
those little hands.</p>

<p class="indent">They stopped under the plum tree and the father
pointed to the branches. Umé looked, and the sight
of the tree sent the blood into her face and then
out of it. The buds all over the branches were
shyly shaking out their white petals.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé heard her father say, &quot;We must now write
fitting poems and fasten them to the heavenly-blossoming
branches.&quot; She saw all the family go back
into the house for the brushes, ink and slips of paper,
but she remained under the tree. She was too
unhappy to make poems, and she felt sure that no
thought of hers could be pleasing to the gods at
this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Benten Sama heard my prayer,&quot; she whispered;
&quot;and while I was disobedient, the plum tree has
blossomed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a few moments her mother returned to the
garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Condescend to hear my unworthy poem,&quot; she
said, and read it aloud from a slip of paper. &quot;The
illustrious sun called to the brown buds and the
blossoms obeyed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
Umé hung her head. She only, it seemed, had
been disobedient; even the buds had obeyed the call
of the sun.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Tara ran from the house. &quot;My miserable
poem is about the lovely sunset,&quot; he said, and
read, &quot;The joyful blossoms blush under the rosy
glances of the sunset sky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The father took the poems and fastened them to
a branch of the tree. As he did so he looked down
at his little daughter. &quot;What unhappy thought
clouds your face, Umé-ko?&quot; he asked gently.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé began to cry. It was a long time since she
had done such a thing. Little Japanese children
are always taught not to permit their faces to show
either grief or anger; but Umé's tears fell in spite
of all her efforts to keep them back.</p>

<p class="indent">At the sight of her tears a silence fell upon the
whole family. Even little Yuki looked at her in
surprise as she told the story of her disobedience.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the grandmother who spoke first.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our spirits are poisoned that you have been so
forgetful of our teaching,&quot; she said; &quot;but I have
learned many things in my long life. It is our honorable
privilege to forgive your disobedience, if
you are truly sorry for it, because this is your
birthday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Little Umé counted that forgiveness as the best
of all her birthday gifts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h3">TEI BUYS A DOLL</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A whole year of months is a very long time,
is it not, Umé?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Tei.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you like to stay shut up in a dark room
as long as that, the way the dolls do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No indeed, Tei, and I would not stay shut up.
I would find some way out and would run away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as we did on your birthday,&quot; said Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Tei, why did you speak of that? I had
put that unworthy memory away in a dark place
with all my other bad deeds and was never going
to think of it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as we put away the dolls in the godown
after the Dolls' Festival is over, Umé?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé laughed. &quot;I had not thought of that, but
it is so,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">All the time the two little girls were talking they
were busily preparing breakfasts for their dolls.
They had five or six small trays and on each one
they placed chopsticks and bowls, and cups about
as big as thimbles.</p>

<p class="indent">The room in which they were playing was the
honorable guest room, the best one in the Utsuki
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
house. On one side of the room was a sight to
make any little girl jump for joy. As many as five
long shelves had been placed along the wall, arranged
one above another like steps, and more than
one hundred dolls were grouped on the shelves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here are dolls of all honorable sizes! Ten sen
for each, and all honorable prices!&quot; chanted Umé,
just as she had heard the toy-peddler cry.</p>

<p class="indent">There were indeed dolls of all sizes and kinds.
There were big dolls and little dolls, boy dolls and
girl dolls. Some were over a hundred years old,
and others looked quite new.</p>

<p class="indent">On the top shelf stood five emperors with their
empresses, and on the lowest shelf, among the toys,
Haru was standing beside a new doll which Umé's
mother had given her for this Dolls' Festival.</p>

<p class="indent">This festival, on the third day of the third month,
is the most important one of the whole year to
little Japanese girls. For nearly a week Umé and
her mother had been busy preparing for this festival.
They had set the shelves in place, covered
them with gorgeous red cotton crêpe, and had then
brought boxes and boxes and bags and bags of dolls
and toys from the godown.</p>

<p class="indent">The godown is the fireproof building which may
be seen in almost every Japanese garden. It is
built of brick or stone, usually painted white, and
has a black tiled roof and a heavy door which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
always shut and locked. If the family is a very
wealthy one, with a great many treasures, the godown
must be large; if there are but few treasures
the building may be smaller.</p>

<p class="indent">It is quite necessary to have some such place,
which cannot easily be destroyed, because Japan
is so often visited by earthquakes, and in the cities
there are often terrible fires. Perhaps this explains
why the Japanese have so little furniture and so few
ornaments in their houses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope that there will not be a fire or an earthquake
while the dolls are in the house,&quot; said Umé,
standing off to see if there were a pair of chopsticks
on each tray.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many dolls are there on the shelves?&quot;
asked Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; answered Umé. &quot;There are all
of mine and my mother's and my mother's mother's.
And again there are some of her mother's mother's.
And besides that there are some of her mother's
mother's, and so on, and so on,--to the time of
Confucius.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That can't be quite true, Umé,&quot; said Tei, who
was always very exact in her statements. &quot;Confucius
lived many hundred years ago, and I don't
think there is a doll in all Japan as old as that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said, 'and so on and so on,'&quot; said Umé. &quot;If
you keep on you must get to Confucius some time.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
She filled the little dishes with rice-cakes for the
dolls' breakfasts while she talked, and Tei poured
tea into the tiny cups.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Umé, when your words once make an honorable
beginning they always have trouble in finding
an end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Tei, sometimes it might be well if your own
words were sooner to find an honorable end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tei laughed and changed the subject. &quot;I have
heard,&quot; she said, &quot;that there is a country where
the little girls do not have a Dolls' Festival.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Umé, &quot;I also have heard as
much, and that they sometimes give away their
dolls when they are too old to play with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give them away! Give the dear dolls away!&quot;
cried Tei, fairly choking with horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but perhaps they do not respect them as
much as we do,&quot; said Umé, as she placed a breakfast
tray before an emperor and empress on their
throne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There must be some reason for it,&quot; said Tei.
&quot;Of course they cannot have a Dolls' Festival if
they do not keep their dolls. But still there is no
need to keep the dolls if they never have a festival.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two children stood back and looked at the
shelves. On the step below the emperors knelt the
court musicians, some playing on the koto, some
on the samisen, and others beating tiny drums.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
There were also many court ladies, dressed in lovely
silks and crêpes, their black hair fastened with
jeweled hairpins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are they not beautiful?&quot; asked Tei, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked tenderly at the lower shelves, where
the more common dolls and toys were placed.
&quot;These are like the people we see every day, and
I love them,&quot; she told Tei; &quot;but when I look at
the emperor dolls it makes me think of our own
beloved Emperor, and I would give up all my toys
for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tei, &quot;I would give my life for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment she caught sight of a baby doll
tied to the back of its nurse, and it reminded her
of something very pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I held my new baby brother in my arms this
morning,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad of the honorable baby,&quot; said Umé,
&quot;because now you are permitted to share the Festival
of the Dolls with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; added Tei, &quot;and I am also permitted to
go to the shops to-day and buy a new doll. See all
the sen the august father gave me this morning,&quot;
and Tei took a handful of coins from her sleeve
pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé clapped her hands. &quot;We will go as soon
as all the dolls have had their breakfast,&quot; she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
&quot;I will strap Haru on my back, and you shall strap
your new doll on your back, and we will play that
they are truly babies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sprang to her feet as she said it, and danced
up and down the room, clapping her hands and
singing a queer little tune.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have the most honorably best time in the
whole year when the Dolls' Festival comes,&quot; she
cried.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not to be wondered at. Then all the dolls
and toys and games that little girls love to play
with are set out on the shelves in the honorable
guest room; and for three days they have a holiday
from school and play all the day long.</p>

<p class="indent">The doll-shops are always merry with children
waiting to buy dolls and crowded with dolls waiting
to be bought. But there were so many interesting
things to see in the streets that Tei and Umé
were a long time in reaching the doll-shop.</p>

<p class="indent">Once they stopped to watch the firemen who ran
past them on their way to a fire.</p>

<p class="indent">The fire-stations in Tokio are tall ladders which
are made to stand upright in the street, with a tub
at the top in which the watchman sits. This tub
looks like a crow's-nest on the mast of a vessel.
Beside it is a big bell which the watchman strikes
when he sees a fire anywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">The firemen run through the streets headed by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
man carrying a large paper standard, which they
place near the burning house. They are very helpful
in saving the women and children, but as they
dislike to desert their standard they are not always
of much use in putting out the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">House-owners give the firemen a great many
presents to keep them faithful to their duty.</p>

<p class="indent">As the two little girls watched the men running
to the fire with a little box of a hand-engine, and
with the beautiful standard in the lead, they thought
it a fine sight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tara says he is going to be a fireman when he
grows up,&quot; said Umé. &quot;He says it is because a
fireman gets so many presents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tei shook her head. &quot;It is a sad thing when
a fire burns a thousand houses as it did in our city
last year,&quot; she said. &quot;I do not like to think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We need have no fear,&quot; said Umé lightly. &quot;Our
fathers have extra houses packed away in their
godowns.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; said Tei, &quot;but many others are
not so wisely fortunate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then they reached the doll-shop and the fires
were forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the lovely dolls!&quot; cried Umé clapping her
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">There were a hundred bright kimono sleeves
pushing and reaching toward the shelves of dolls in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the shop. There were fifty little Japanese girls
chattering together about the smiling face of one
and the beautiful silk kimono of another.</p>

<p class="indent">The click of wooden clogs, the clank of Japanese
money, and the merry talk of the children, all trying
to be heard at the same time, made it a jolly
affair.</p>

<p class="indent">The doll chosen by Tei was the one which was
being admired by two other little girls at the same
moment. It was a boy baby with pink cheeks and
black eyes and a little fringe of very black hair;
and it was dressed in a lovely red silk kimono covered
with yellow chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very like the new brother at home,&quot; said
Tei, as she counted out the sen and gave them to
the doll-shopman.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she strapped the doll on her back and the
two little girls went home slowly, talking of the
wonderful baby brother who had come to Tei's
house the week before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The house has to be very quiet, because the
honorable baby is not yet well,&quot; said Tei. &quot;He
has been very ill. I could not have gone with you
to the city streets on your birthday if the baby
had been well. Every one was glad to have me
out of the house, so that it might be kept very still.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h3">THE DOLLS' FESTIVAL</p>

<p class="indent">When Umé and Tei reached home, carrying their
dolls on their backs, they found Yuki on the
veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My geta! Yuki's geta!&quot; the baby called as
soon as she saw her sister coming down the garden
path; and she stood on one clog and held up the
other little white-stockinged foot.</p>

<p class="indent">Small as she was, Yuki-ko could slip her feet into
her wooden clogs without any help when she could
find them; but Saké, the dog, generally found them
first and as there was never a bone for him to hide,
he liked to hide the tiny shoes.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, as usual, one of the clogs was missing from
the flat step where the baby had last left it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps it is under the plum tree, O Yuki
San,&quot; said Umé, and ran to find it, but it was not
there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a pity that Saké makes us so much trouble!&quot;
she said to Tei. &quot;It is plain to be seen that
the good dog Shiro was no ancestor of his.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What good dog Shiro?&quot; asked Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dog of the man who made the dead trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
to blossom,&quot; answered Umé as she looked under
the quince bushes; but the missing clog was not
there. Several days later the gardener found it
buried under the bush of snow blossoms; but Umé
gave up looking for it when she did not find it in
any of Saké's favorite places.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is such a long time since I heard the story
of the good man who made trees blossom, that I
have nearly forgotten it,&quot; said Tei; but Umé was
talking to Yuki.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be happy, little treasure-flower,&quot; she said to the
baby. &quot;You shall have a new pair of clogs; and
you may come with us now and help serve tea to
the honorable dolls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Baby Yuki forgot her clogs at once. She knelt
upon the floor and held up her tiny hands for the
tea-bowl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Umé! She is too little to whip the tea,&quot;
said Tei when she saw that her cousin meant to
give the baby a bowl of tea powder and a bamboo
brush with which to whip it into foam.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will watch her,&quot; answered Umé. &quot;It may
be that the dolls forget all they learn about the tea-ceremony
when they are shut up in the godown for
a whole year. While I am teaching Yuki San, they
may learn it all over again by most carefully watching
us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tei laughed. &quot;The illustrious dolls always behave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
most honorably well,&quot; she said. &quot;Perhaps it
is because they do not forget from year to year,
but spend all their time in remembering.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then there was a happy little gurgle from
the baby.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé turned quickly to see what she was doing.
&quot;O Yuki San! Yuki San!&quot; she cried, running
to the rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was too late! While Umé had been talking
with Tei, the baby had been pouring the tea
over her head. She was still holding the bowl
above her head when Umé looked, and the water
was still trickling down over her hair and into her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled sweetly up into Umé's face. &quot;The
honorable fountain!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Japanese tea-ceremony has nothing to do
with the honorable fountain in the garden,&quot; said
Umé as she clapped her hands for old Maru, the
nurse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naruhodo!&quot; said old Maru, as she brought
towels and wiped the tea from the baby and the
mat with many exclamations of amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naruhodo!&quot; she repeated, as she watched the
two older children try to teach something of the
tea-ceremony to the baby.</p>

<p class="indent">But Yuki San was soon tired of sitting still. She
like to watch the tea powder foam in the bowl, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
when she tried to put her tiny hands into the dish
and play they were fishes, Umé gave her a doll
and sent her off to play by herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will never do for the dolls to see such unworthy
actions,&quot; Umé told Tei. &quot;They will think
it is all a part of the august tea-ceremony.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was much easier to teach the dolls without the
baby's help, and there was everything to teach them
with. There was a toy kitchen with its charcoal
brazier, its brushes and dishes. There was a toy
work-box with thread, needles and silk.</p>

<p class="indent">There were toy quilts and wooden pillows and
flower vases; and there were toy jinrikishas with
their runners.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé and Tei taught the dolls the proper bowings
for the street and those for the house. They
changed the food on the trays, and taught the girl
dolls that they must most carefully wait upon
the boy dolls, as Umé herself had been taught to
wait upon Tara, although she was older than her
brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé even read aloud with much emphasis from
the &quot;Book of Learning for Women&quot;: &quot;Let the
children be always taught to speak the simple truth,
to stand upright in their proper places, and to listen
with respectful attention.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There are many other directions in the book, all
of which the little women of Japan learn by heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Umé would have read many of the rules to the
dolls, but her mother called both children to leave
their play and go with the grandmother and old
Maru to listen to story-telling in the street of
theaters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a very different thing to tell the simple
truth at one time and to listen to honorable stories
at another,&quot; said Umé to the dolls as she left them.</p>

<p class="indent">In the street of theaters are many little booths in
which there are men who tell the most enchanting
stories. Sometimes they tell fairy stories, sometimes
ghost stories, and sometimes stories of Japanese
gods and heroes. Umé and Tei liked the fairy
stories best of all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old man in this booth tells fairy stories
faithfully well,&quot; said the grandmother as they
stopped before a tiny house decorated with paper
parasols and lanterns, and with a long red banner
floating above it from a bamboo pole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honorably deign to enter,&quot; said a little woman
crouching at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Maru gave the woman four sen and the little
party entered and joined a group of about twenty
women and girls who were seated on mats in front
of the story-teller.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear, now, the story of the good old man who
made dead trees to blossom!&quot; said the story-teller,
waving his fan over his head and then clapping it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
in his hand three times to call attention to his
words.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé and Tei looked at one another and clasped
their hands beneath their chins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just what we were respectfully speaking about
in the morning hour!&quot; murmured Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé nodded and would have said something in
answer, but her grandmother said, &quot;Hush!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once upon a time two men lived side by side
in a little village,&quot; said the story-teller, looking at
Umé. Umé again nodded her head. She knew
the story perfectly well, but the Japanese children
love to hear the same stories told over and over
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One of these men was kind and generous,&quot; continued
the story-teller. &quot;The other was envious
and cruel. Neither one of them had any children
to pay them honor in their old age; but the kind
man and his wife were always doing good. One
day they found a dog which they took to their home
and taught as they would have taught a child, to be
obedient and faithful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They named the dog Shiro, and fed him with
the mochi cake which tastes best after the New
Year is made welcome with much joy and ceremony.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé and Tei nodded and smiled at one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Shiro knew nothing about the New Year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
festival,&quot; went on the story-teller. &quot;He was happy
all the day long in following the good old man
about and getting a kind pat from the gentle hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One day he began digging for himself in a corner
of the garden. Scratch! went his two paws as
fast as he could make the dirt fly, and the good old
man took his spade and dug in the spot to find what
could be hidden in the dirt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was rewarded by finding an honorable quantity
of coins; enough to keep him and his wife comfortable
for many months.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the envious man, the unworthy neighbor,
hearing of this good fortune, asked to borrow the
dog.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Yes, truly,' answered the other and sent Shiro
home with his neighbor, although the obedient
creature had always been driven away from the
neighbor's gate with sticks and harsh words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Now you must find treasure for me,' said the
bad man who knew nothing about kindness to animals,
for he pushed the poor dog's nose into the
earth so deeply that Shiro was nearly smothered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dog did truly begin scratching, but when
the cruel man dug in that place, he found nothing
but rubbish, which so enraged him that he killed
the obedient animal and buried his body under a
pine tree.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At last the good man, wondering why Shiro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
did not return, went to his neighbor and asked the
reason. 'Ah, he was a bad dog!' answered the
other. 'He would find nothing but rubbish in the
ground for me, and so I killed him and he lies under
the pine tree.'</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'It was a great pity to kill him,' said the good
man. 'We should be kind to all animals, because
it may be that the souls of our ancestors return
and live in their bodies.'</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'What is done cannot now be helped,' the bad
neighbor answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Shiro's master bought the tree, cut it down
and took it home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé and Tei nodded again. The mystery was
to begin in the story and they drew closer to the
grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The spirit of the little dog spoke to his master
in the night,&quot; said the story-teller, &quot;and told him to
make a tub from the pieces of the tree. It must
be just such a tub as the mochi-makers use at New
Year's time, and in the tub the old man must make
mochi for Shiro.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So the good old man did as he was bidden,
thinking to put some of the cakes before the tablet
on the god-shelf as an offering to the spirit of the
obedient dog.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But when he put the barley into the tub and
began to pound it, the quantity of barley increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
until there was all that the man and his wife could
use for their needs for a long time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This also, the envious neighbor saw, and he
borrowed the tub as he had borrowed the dog,
thinking to have as much barley meal for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But although the tub overflowed with the grain,
it was all worthless; so poor that no one could eat
it. A second time the man was angered and he
pounded the tub to pieces in his rage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The patient old man gathered up the pieces
and used them for fire-wood, saving the ashes as
the spirit of Shiro directed him to do.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In his garden there was an old dead tree. The
spirit of the dog bade him sprinkle some of the
ashes upon the branches of this tree and he obediently
did so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Immediately, pop! The branches were suddenly
covered with beautiful double cherry blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;People from far and wide flocked to see the
sight, and among them was a prince who begged the
old man to do the same thing for one of his trees
which had long been dead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When his tree blossomed as the first had done,
he was so pleased that he gave the old man many
valuable gifts of silk and rice and sent him home,
to be known as the 'old man who could make dead
trees blossom.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When the story-teller finished, he disappeared behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
a red curtain and there was nothing for Umé
and Tei to do but go home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a good thing that the story was no longer,&quot;
said Umé, &quot;because Tara is going to help me build
a toy garden for my dolls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tara helped to build the garden, to be sure, but
the two little girls waited upon him and listened
to him, and not once forgot that in Japan girls
and women must follow their brothers. They must
never try to lead them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go and get the spade from the garden-house,
Umé,&quot; Tara said to his sister. &quot;Bring some small
stones from the rockery,&quot; he told Tei, and both little
girls obeyed without a word.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the third day of the Dolls' Festival
there was a charming toy garden at one end of the
veranda. In the garden there was a tiny lake bordered
with flowering shrubs, a little hill with trees
growing around it, a path leading to the lake beside
which grew peach trees in full bloom, and there
were even two tiny stone lanterns and a little temple
on the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been a wonderful holiday for the little
girls and they were sorry that it was all over, but
they cheerfully helped to pack the dolls and toys
away in boxes and carry them back to the godown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h3">A VISIT TO THE TEMPLE</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Haha San,&quot; said Umé, &quot;when we took little
Yuki San to the temple for the first time, with
whom did I sit in the jinrikisha?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not strange that you have no memory of
it, little Plum Blossom,&quot; said her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, honorable mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you were ill from eating too many
sweets the day before, and had to stay at home in
your bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé laughed. &quot;Now I do remember it,&quot; she
said. &quot;My unworthy head danced like a geisha
girl when I tried to stand on my two feet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's mother looked at her little daughter reprovingly.
&quot;Do not speak so easily of such girls,
Umé-ko,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was Tara taken to the temple when he was
thirty days old?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Mother San, with whom did I ride then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With O Ba San.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could go to-day with Tei,&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
&quot;It is time for them even now to begin the journey,&quot;
answered her mother. &quot;You may perhaps
ride in the same jinrikisha with your little cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé made a deep bow to her mother, slipped into
her clogs at the veranda step, and ran swiftly
through the garden to her cousin's house.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything there was in a great state of excitement.
The new baby, dressed in a most gorgeous
red silk kimono with the family crest embroidered
on the back and sleeves, was going to make his
first visit to the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you may come with me,&quot; said Tei to Umé,
after asking the honorable father's permission.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Umé Riding in a Jinrikisha. <i>Page</i> 37.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The pale little mother leaned back in her jinrikisha
beside the nurse who carried the beautiful boy.</p>

<p class="indent">The father, very proud to have a son who would
carry on the family name, rode in the first jinrikisha,
and the little party took their way to the
famous Kameido Temple in the eastern part of the
city.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was not until three days ago that the baby
was well enough to have his head shaved,&quot; Tei confided
to Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought it must always be done on the
seventh day,&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">Tei shook her head. &quot;The august father commanded
that it should not be done,&quot; she said. &quot;The
baby was so frail that there have been no visits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
from anyone since he was first seen in our house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the baby might just as well have been a
girl,&quot; said Umé decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no!&quot; said Tei. &quot;There have been dozens
of presents of rice and silk, and many other things.
And there have been letters of congratulation. And
to-day, when we return from the temple, many,
many people will come to see the baby, because they
could not come before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What name was given to the baby on the
seventh day?&quot; asked Umé curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is to be called Onda,&quot; answered Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">Before Umé could ask any more questions they
had reached the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything seemed to go wrong with Tei. She
caught her clog as she was getting out of the
jinrikisha and fell upon her nose. It bled a little,
just enough to make her say pitifully, &quot;Oh, how
truly sad! It will never bring good luck to the
dear brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé was always quick at thinking of a way
out of trouble. Near the entrance to the temple
stood a deep basin filled with water. With this
water everybody washes his hands before going
in to pray. Umé lifted a spoonful of the water and
rubbed it over her cousin's nose. &quot;That will make
it as well as ever,&quot; she told Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that in your other hand?&quot; asked Tei,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
seeing that Umé was using only one hand, and that
the other was tightly closed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a rice-cake to feed to the goldfish in the
temple lake.&quot; One can always buy rice-cakes at
the temple gate, but Umé had thoughtfully brought
one from her home.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé would have almost preferred feeding the fish
to seeing the ceremony of placing the new baby
under the protecting care of the patron saint of the
temple. Baby Onda's father had chosen the God of
Learning to be his son's patron saint. He wished
to have the child become very studious and know
thoroughly all the wisdom of Confucius and the old,
old gods of learning and wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">Before going into the temple everyone slipped
out of his clogs, washed his hands, and made several
bows at the entrance.</p>

<p class="indent">Tei's father then pulled a rope which rang a bell
to attract the attention of the god. There was a
moment when he clapped his hands together three
times to be sure that the god was listening. After
that he asked very earnestly that his little son might
be carefully guarded and guided along the rough
path of wisdom. Then he clapped his hands twice
to show that his prayer was ended.</p>

<p class="indent">It was so solemn and impressive to little Umé that
she forgot her rice-cake and let it drop to the temple
floor as she clasped her own hands in prayer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
Then followed the gift to the gods, and one to the
priest of the temple. The priest blessed the new
baby and he was safely placed under the care of
Sugawara-no-Michizanè, the God of Literature, in
the Kameido Temple in the city of Tokio.</p>

<p class="indent">The ceremony was not very long. The moment
it was over Umé and Tei stole as quickly as they
could out of the temple, and ran down to the lake
where the goldfish were waiting to be fed.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course they stayed there so long, feeding first
one fish and then another, and watching them
spread their fan-like tails and glide away to nibble
the bits of rice-cake, that Tei's father came to look
for them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have no more time,&quot; he said gently to them.
&quot;Unless we are soon at our unworthy house, all the
honorable guests will be there before us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The jinrikisha runners were told to hurry home,
and they obeyed so well that Umé and Tei clung to
one another and gave little shrieks of delight.</p>

<p class="indent">Hardly had they reached home when the guests
really did begin to arrive. All the relatives and
friends came by ones and twos and threes; some in
jinrikishas and some on foot,--all who had sent
presents and all who had waited to bring them.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé and Tei counted the different pairs of clogs
that were left at the veranda steps, and there were
over one hundred pairs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;Such an illustrious crowd!&quot; said Tei, drawing
in her breath with excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">But there was little time to count and look. The
two children were needed to help pass tea and cakes
to the visitors. It was dark before everybody was
at last gone and the baby's first party was over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Baby Onda is tired with so much looking and
holding and praising,&quot; said Umé to her mother as
they went home through the gardens. &quot;He will
never go to sleep again, or else he will sleep for a
week of days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is an honorable boy child,&quot; answered her
mother. &quot;A boy must learn early to bear hardships.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is no hardship to receive honorable praise,&quot;
said little Umé.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h3">CHERRY-BLOSSOM TIME</p>


<p class="indent">&quot;The cherry trees in Ueno Park are in full blossom
to-day,&quot; read Umé's father in the morning
paper. &quot;The Emperor visited the park yesterday
to see the beautiful flowers.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 519px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;The Cherry Trees in Ueno Park are in full Blossom.&quot;
<i>Page 42.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Umé turned from looking at the cherry blossoms
in the garden to look at her mother who stood on
the veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something will honorably give way in my heart,
O Haha San,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, Umé-ko?&quot; asked her
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My heart is greatly joyous over so many blossoms,&quot;
answered the little girl. &quot;It has grown so
big that I would feel better if it should take itself to
the godown and leave me without it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Foolish Umé!&quot; said her mother, but she smiled
at the child's fancy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The joy began to grow with the first pink buds,&quot;
Umé went on, &quot;and now that all the cherry trees
everywhere are in blossom,--in our garden, in
Tei's garden, and in all the gardens; along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
streets and river banks, and in all the parks, my
heart is bursting with gladness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When hearts feel that way,&quot; said her mother,
&quot;it is because they wish to offer thanks to the gods.
We will all go to the temple to-day and leave a gift,
and then we will go to the beautiful Ueno Park,
where there will be many others who feel the way
that you do in their hearts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the way we Japanese always feel when the
cherry trees hang out their pink garlands,&quot; said
Umé's father.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara was bouncing a ball in the garden and heard
this talk about the cherry blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait until my festival,&quot; he said, &quot;and then you
will see what it is really like to feel gladness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your festival,&quot; said Umé, &quot;and pray what may
your honorable festival be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fish-tree festival is the one I like,&quot; answered
Tara, and he gave his ball a great toss into
the air.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked puzzled for a moment, then she cried,
&quot;Oh, he means the Flag Festival!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, children,&quot; interrupted their mother,
&quot;find the lunch boxes and help to put all in peaceful
readiness for our journey to the park.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tara picked up Baby Yuki and gave her a toss
into the air. In doing so he discovered that she
had lost her name-label. It is a common thing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
a Japanese child to wear a wooden label tied around
his neck, on which his name and address are printed.
Then if he is lost he can be returned to his home.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara made a new label and tied it so firmly
around the baby's neck that her tiny fingers could
not possibly loosen the strings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, O Yuki San,&quot; he said, &quot;you are all ready
to go to the park, where you can get lost a dozen
times if you wish, honorable Sister,&quot; and he gave
her another toss for good luck.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Umé found that her clog string
was broken. &quot;I may as well get a new string for
each clog,&quot; she said. &quot;When one breaks, I find that
the other soon breaks also, for loneliness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But there were no extra strings hanging in the
clog-closet where some were usually to be found,
and Umé had a great hunt for them.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki San, and not Saké, was the thief this time.
She had put them carefully away in one of the
drawers of the writing cabinet the day before, when
she was playing that her shoe was a doll-baby and
must be tied to her back with its strings.</p>

<p class="indent">By the time they were all dressed in their finest
clothes, three jinrikishas were waiting at the gate,
and Tara rode off proudly with his father, while
Baby San sat beside her mother, and Umé rode with
her grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">The streets were crowded with people dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
in gay kimonos and carrying paper parasols or fans.
Some were riding, some were walking, and all were
happily chatting and laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is everyone in the whole world going to Ueno
Park?&quot; Umé asked her grandmother, and immediately
forgot her question in listening to the sounds
of gongs and tinkling bells that filled the air. The
joyous sound of bells is always a part of the Cherry-blossom
Festival in Tokio, and makes the city a very
merry place.</p>

<p class="indent">The long avenue leading up to the entrance of
the park, which is on the brow of a high hill, was
arched overhead with the blossoming branches of
the cherry trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The pink mist almost hides the blue sky,&quot; said
Umé, &quot;but the sunshine comes dancing through.
See how gently it touches the pink petals with its
rosy light!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little party rode through the park looking at
the cherry trees and watching the crowds of people.
Umé kept her poor grandmother's head bobbing to
right and left as she spoke of one strange sight and
then another.</p>

<p class="indent">First it was, &quot;O Ba San, look at the Japanese
baby in the American baby-carriage. It cannot
be that he likes it as well as riding on his sister's
back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next it was, &quot;O Ba San, see the little foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
children playing with the cake-woman's stove.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé would have liked to stop the jinrikisha man
and watch the white-faced children as they made
little batter cakes and fried them over the charcoal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must not stop now,&quot; said her grandmother.
&quot;Your honorable father will tell us when we may
stop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé came as near pouting as a Japanese maiden
can. &quot;I think I have heard that the foreign children
tell their fathers when they wish to stop in the
honorable ride,&quot; she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are all barbarians, those foreigners,&quot; said
her grandmother. &quot;You can see by the gardens
of flowers that they wear upon their heads, that
they know nothing of propriety.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé, who had never worn a hat in her life, could
say nothing to that. Every little foreign girl she
saw was wearing a hat on her head on which there
were many flowers of half a dozen different colors
and kinds. Although it was a sight to hurt her
eyes, Umé would have been glad to leave the jinrikisha
and study the dresses of the little foreigners.
Most of all she wished to join them in their play of
cake-making.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They must be glad to come to Japan and learn
so many new ways to be happy, O Ba San,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">The grandmother did not quite understand Umé's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
way of thinking. &quot;In what way?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To ride among the beautiful cherry trees, with
their delicious pink odors, in the beginning,&quot; said
Umé. &quot;I know that in no other country can the
trees be so lovely and hold so many flowers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As if her father knew that Umé longed to see
something of the foreign children's play, he stopped
his own jinrikisha man at that very moment, and
the rest of his party stopped beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">Under a particularly large and beautiful cherry
tree a group of both foreign and Japanese children
were gathered around a peddler who carried a tray
of candies upon his head. In one hand he held
a drum and on his shoulder perched a monkey
dressed in a bright colored kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">The man danced and sang a funny song about
the troubles of Daruma, a snow man. Once in a
while he beat the drum, and all the time he was
jumping and twisting about until it seemed as if his
tray of candies must surely fall off his head to the
ground; but it never did.</p>

<p class="indent">When the monkey jumped from his master's
shoulder and snatched off one of the boys' caps,
putting it on his own head, all the people, big and
little, screamed with joy.</p>

<p class="indent">By that time a great crowd of merrymakers had
collected, and Umé's father told his coolie to go on.
So the little party started on again, and soon passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
an open space among the trees where Japanese
fireworks were shooting into the air. The Japanese
send off their fireworks in the daytime, as well as
at night, to make their festivals more festive.</p>

<p class="indent">The swish of the quick flight of a rocket into the
air made every one look up. In a moment a big
paper bird popped out of the rocket and came sailing
slowly down to light on the top of one of the trees.</p>

<p class="indent">Then another rocket, and still another, was sent
up, and from one came a golden dragon with a long
red tongue and a still longer tail.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's father dismissed all of the jinrikisha
coolies, and after they had watched the fireworks a
little while, the family went into a tea-house to eat
their lunch and rest from the confusion.</p>

<p class="indent">As Tara looked out over the gaily dressed crowds
he said boastfully, &quot;There can be no other country
in the world with such fine, brave people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true that we are a brave people,&quot; his father
answered. &quot;Many times, when I was no older than
you are, little son, has my mother wakened me very
early in the morning and put a toy sword into my
hand. 'Your companions are out playing the
sword-game. Join them!' were her words. And
although the ground was white with snow, and I
was very sleepy, I always went as she bade me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tara looked at his father in admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There has been much fighting with real swords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
here in this very park,&quot; his father continued.
&quot;There was once a big battle under these cherry
trees where you see nothing to-day but crowds of
happy people with no thought of anything but enjoying
the Cherry-blossom Festival.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not be perfectly happy until I have made
cakes as the foreign children were doing,&quot; said
Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">In the path outside the tea-house Umé had caught
sight of a woman with a little charcoal fire in a
copper brazier, which she thought her father might
also see. The little old woman was neatly dressed,
and carried over her right shoulder a bamboo pole
from which hung the brazier, a griddle, some ladles
and cake-turners. There was also a big blue and
white jar of batter and a smaller one of sauce.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's father beckoned to the woman, and to the
children's joy she brought the things to the tea-house
door, where Umé was allowed to make cakes
for the whole family.</p>

<p class="indent">Baby San toddled up the steps with a cake for
the grandmother. On the way she tumbled down
and dropped it in the dirt. Then a fresh one had to
be made and carried very carefully up the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">There were many children, with their fathers
and mothers, coming and going past the tea-house.
There were groups of students and parties of young
ladies; there were jugglers and toy peddlers; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
over everything the cherry trees were scattering
their falling petals.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a merry-go-round near the tea-house,
and the crowds of people made it a gay place with
their fun and frolic.</p>

<p class="indent">It was lucky that Baby Yuki had her tag around
her neck. Once she slipped beyond her mother's
watchful care and was only found after much
questioning and searching.</p>

<p class="indent">When, at last, she was placed once more in her
mother's arms, the grandmother said that it was
time to go home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have seen many cherry blossoms, and Umé's
heart must be peacefully small once more,&quot; she said.
&quot;It is better to go home before we tire of so much
merriment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The jinrikisha men trotted all the way home, and
the happy day was over all too soon.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE FLAG FESTIVAL</p>

<p class="indent">It was the fifth day of the fifth month, which is
the day of the Flag Festival in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara slipped out of his wooden clogs and ran
into the room where Umé was gathering her books
together for school. &quot;Baby Onda's fish is up at
last,&quot; he shouted, &quot;and as far as you can see the
ocean of air is full of fishes. Did I not say that
the fifth day of the fifth month would be filled with
gladness?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Tara, but I have far too much to do to
talk with you now,&quot; said Umé very primly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least you can condescend to come out on the
veranda just one moment to look at cousin Onda's
fish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, honorable Brother,&quot; said Umé, and
she followed him to the veranda.</p>

<p class="indent">Both children laughed aloud at the sight of the
enormous paper carp flying from the top of the
bamboo pole on their cousin's house. The fish was
at least twenty feet long and was made of strong
Japanese paper. Its great mouth and eyes were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
wide open and it had swallowed so much air that
it looked filled to bursting. A mighty wind blew
it this way and that, up and down, making it look
like a real fish that had been caught with a hook
and was trying to escape.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Onda's father is augustly proud because he has
a son,&quot; said Umé. &quot;He has found the biggest fish
in all Tokio to fly, and the people will know that he
has only a very little son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will grow larger,&quot; said Tara loyally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And as he grows larger the fish will grow
smaller,&quot; answered Umé. &quot;Your own fish is only
half as large as Onda's.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From a pole in the Utsuki house flew Tara's fish,
while from poles as far as the eye could see flew
fishes of all sizes and colors. Some poles held two,
three, or even five or six fishes. There was a fish
for every boy who lived in every house, and every
fish was a carp, because in Japan the carp is the fish
that can swim against the swift river currents and
leap over waterfalls.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">There was a Fish for every Boy. <i>Page 52.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">For the little Japanese girls there is the Dolls'
Festival, and for the boys is this Flag Festival,
when they stay at home from school and play all
day long. They fly kites, spin tops, tell stories and
are told tales of the brave heroes of Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">In the room where the dolls had sat in state for
the girls there is now a shelf for the boys' toys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
There are many toy soldiers, figures of great heroes,
men in armor, men wearing helmets and carrying
swords, and some carrying guns or drawing tiny
cannon on wheels. Tara had his soldiers arranged
as if they were fighting a battle, and it was truly
a most warlike scene.</p>

<p class="indent">The morning had been full of excitement. Tara
had already observed the day by taking a bath in
very hot water steeped with iris flowers. He had
arranged his toys and soldiers. He had been to
the kite-maker and bought a huge kite decorated
with a picture of the sun in the brilliant red color
which is dear to all Japanese children.</p>

<p class="indent">He had also run over in his mind the stories that
he could remember of Japanese warriors of the
past, for well he knew that before the day was
over his mother would question him about them
all.</p>

<p class="indent">He had also recited his catechism to Umé, and
had answered bravely all the questions as she read
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you love best in the world?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Emperor, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better than your father and mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is the father of my father and mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will you give the Emperor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All my best toys, and my life when he needs
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
Now he was busy tying a long silk string to his
kite and getting it ready to fly.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé forgot her school books and ran down the
garden path to look once more at the bed of iris
which was now in full bloom beside the brook.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow I will gather some of the leaves
and flowers,&quot; she said, &quot;and arrange them in the
tall green jar for the alcove. That will keep away
evil spirits from our home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she ran back to the house, making the
motions of the flying fishes with her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I were an honorable boy,&quot; she cried, &quot;I
would sail away from Japan to every country where
there are dragons, and kill them all. Then I
would come back home again and tell all about it,
so that all the children and their children, as long as
Japan lasts, would learn about me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tara looked at Umé as contemptuously as a Japanese
boy ever looks at his sister, which is not
saying much, because in Japan the boys and girls
are taught to be most polite to each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not the way of a true patriot,&quot; he said.
&quot;We men must stay at home and defend our
country from enemies that may attack us from
without. True glory will find us; we do not need
to run all over the world looking for it, and then
perhaps, miss it after all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well spoken, my son,&quot; said his father from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
the veranda, where he had heard Tara's words. To
Umé he said, &quot;Our bravest men, the men who have
given their lives for their country, and whose
names will ever be spoken with reverence by our
children's children, have died in the home-land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke solemnly, and Tara, who adored his
father, moved close to his side as if to catch his
brave spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé also loved her father. She was grieved
that he should speak to her in a tone of rebuke.
She whirled about and fluttered to his other side,
nestling under his arm and smiling the sweetest of
smiles up into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I see, O Chichi San, why we fly the brave
carp for our boys,&quot; she said prettily, &quot;and why we
steep the hardy iris flower in their bath water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her father looked down into her face. &quot;You
knew that very well before,&quot; he said with a smile.
&quot;You have heard of the wonderful strength of the
carp ever since Tara was born. You know that
every father who flies a paper carp for his son at
this festival time does it with the hope that the boy
will heed the sign and grow courageous and strong
to overcome every obstacle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé still smiled up into her father's face.
She felt that he was not yet quite pleased with her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you not come home early from the honorable
business and tell us stories of the old war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
heroes?&quot; she asked softly. &quot;The mother tells
them faithfully well, leaving out no brave detail,
but she has never fought, as you have done, for our
beloved Emperor. It is you alone who can make
us feel the joy of battle so that even I wish I could
wear a sword and fight with it for our country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé had conquered. Her father put his hand
upon her head in loving consent. &quot;When our
women also are ready to give their lives for Japan,&quot;
he said, &quot;the country will never suffer defeat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé told her cousin Tei later in the day that
one need not always fight to win a victory.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span></p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE SINGING INSECTS</p>

<p class="indent">Umé sat on the edge of the veranda, taking coins
from a little silk bag and spreading them out before
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ichi, ni, san, shi, go,&quot; she counted, up to fourteen.
&quot;Fourteen sen,&quot; she said. &quot;If I had one more
I could buy the kind of singing insect I like best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot; asked Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a kirigirisu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall you buy, then?&quot; asked Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall have to buy a suzumushi, and two other
honorably cheap ones,&quot; Umé told him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask the august father for one more sen,&quot; Tara
advised.</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé shook her head. &quot;The august father
has given me all the sen he has for me this month,&quot;
she answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I have already asked for one more sen,
and that was his honorable answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have one sen which you may have if you will
let me call the kirigirisu partly mine,&quot; said Tara.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
&quot;I have a black cricket, a little grass lark, that I
caught in our own garden last night, and it chirps
so cheerfully that I do not need to buy any other
singing insect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not matter whose insect it is,&quot; said Umé,
&quot;if it only sings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Tara gave his sen to Umé and she went to
find Tei, who went with her down to the street of
shops. There, among numberless other booths, the
children found one where nothing but singing insects
were for sale.</p>

<p class="indent">The insects were of different colors and sizes.
Some were black, some were brown and some were
bright green. The one that Umé chose looked
much like a brown grasshopper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He sings most musically in the hours of darkness,&quot;
said the insect merchant. &quot;While you lie
in your bed he will say to you, 'Tsuzuré--sasé,
sasé, sasé.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both little girls laughed at the words, which
mean, &quot;Torn clothes--patch up, patch up, patch
up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are strange words for the honorable insect-singer,&quot;
said Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">Each insect was in a little cage which was made
of horsehair or fine strands of bamboo. The cages
were of different shapes and sizes for the different
kinds of insects. Some were tall and shaped like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
bee-hive, some were oblong and others were square.
Umé's kirigirisu was in a cage four inches long.</p>

<p class="indent">Tei also had a few sen. She looked at many insects
carefully and finally chose a beautiful bright
green grasshopper that made a sound like the weaving
of a loom:--&quot;Ji-i-i-i, chon-chon! Ji-i-i-i, chon-chon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then home trotted the two little girls with their
cunning cages.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a very warm day and the good mother
was waiting for them with cups of cold tea. She
looked at the insects and smiled at the baby who
kotowed an honorable welcome to them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I was a child,&quot; she said, &quot;my unselfish
mother told me a wise story about those same two
insects.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately the children seated themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will be most respectfully quiet and listen,
if you will tell it to us,&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Long, long ago,&quot; began the mother, &quot;when
Japan was young, there were two faithful and obedient
daughters who supported their blind old
father by the labor of their hands. The elder girl
spent all her days in weaving while the other was
just as industriously sewing. In that way they
took faithful care of their blind father for many
years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Finally the old man died, and so deeply did the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
two daughters mourn for him that soon they died
also.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One summer evening a strange sound was heard
on their graves. It was a new sound that no one
had ever heard there before, and it was made by
two little insects which were swinging and singing
on a blade of grass above the place where the two
daughters lay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the tomb of the elder was a pretty green
insect, producing sounds like those made by a girl
weaving,--'Ji-i-i-i, chon-chon! Ji-i-i-i, chon-chon!'
This was the first weaver-insect. On the tomb of
the younger sister was an insect which kept crying
out,--'Tsuzuré--sasé, sasé! tsuzuré--sasé
sasé, sasé!' ('Torn clothes--patch up, patch up!
Torn clothes--patch up, patch up, patch up!')
This was the first kirigirisu.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Since that time these same little insects cry to
every Japanese mother and daughter to work well
before the cold winter days, to do all the weaving
and sewing and mending and have the winter clothing
ready.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We used to believe that the spirits of the two
girls took these shapes,&quot; she ended.</p>

<p class="indent">In the silence that followed the story, Tei's little
insect sang, &quot;Ji-i-i, chon-chon! Ji-i-i, chon-chon!&quot;
and Umé's answered, &quot;Tsuzuré, sasé, sasé! Tsuzuré,
sasé, sasé!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
The night was creeping over the garden. The
sound of the temple bells rang through the air,
and little flashes of light twinkled in unexpected
places.</p>

<p class="indent">The children gathered closer to the mother and
begged for one more story before bed-time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever hear of Princess Splendor?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">The children never had heard the story, and their
mother told it to them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was a beautiful little moon-child who came
down to the world hundreds of years ago. There
was but one way for her to come, and that was on
a silver moonbeam.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While she sat on a pine branch resting from her
journey, a wood-cutter found her and took her to
his home, where she stayed for many years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the Emperor, passing through the forest,
wondered why the little brown house of the wood-cutter
shone with such a wonderful glow, and when
he found that there was a beautiful moon-child
there, he went to see her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By day or by night it was just the same with the
house; it always shone with the glory of the Princess
Splendor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course the Emperor wished to marry her;
but he had been too late in finding her, because
she was to return to her home in the moon at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
end of twenty years, and the end of the twenty
years had come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She begged to stay with the Emperor and began
to weep, but it was of no use. The moon-mother
took her home and tried to comfort her; but her
tears went on falling, and they take wings to
themselves as fast as they fall. These fireflies are
the golden tears of the lovely Princess Splendor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite dark when the story was finished,
and Tei jumped up. &quot;I must go home and show
the intelligent insect to my honorable mother,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tara and I will walk across the gardens with
you,&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">She reached under the veranda for three slender
bamboo poles, while Tara ran for candles to put in
the paper lanterns which hung on the end of the
poles.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon the three lanterns went bobbing down the
garden path through the dusk, and the sound of
happy voices floated back to the mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was of no use!&quot; said Umé's voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was of no use?&quot; asked Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Princess Splendor could not marry the right
prince,&quot; answered Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother smiled, and rising, carried Yuki San
into the house, while the temple bells were still
ringing through the twilight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h3">A TRIP TO KAMAKURA</p>

<p class="indent">It was a hot morning in midsummer. The
veranda shutters had been open all night and the
shoji had been only half closed so that tiny breezes
might creep through to cool the pink cheek of Umé
San, as she lay on the floor under a thin silk coverlet.</p>

<p class="indent">All night the kirigirisu had sung in his cage near
Umé's bed; and all night the mosquitoes had buzzed
and sung outside of Umé's own cage of green mosquito
netting.</p>

<p class="indent">At four o'clock, just as the sun peeped into the
room, Umé opened her eyes. &quot;Oh, little kirigirisu,&quot;
she whispered, &quot;I like your singing much
better than that of the mosquitoes. Gladly would
I put them all in a cage in the godown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she thought of her morning-glories and pattered
out into the garden to look at them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How lovely they are,&quot; she said, as she touched
them gently with her fingers. &quot;This white one
makes me think of Fujiyama when it is covered
with snow; and this pink one is like the mountain
at sunrise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, the little girl looked across the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
roofs to where her beloved mountain, Fujiyama,
lifted its head like an inverted flower, tinged with
the pink of the rising sun.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then her father came out to look at the
morning-glories, too, and after the morning greetings,
Umé told him her fancy about Fujiyama.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your thought is a poem, little daughter,&quot; said
her father. &quot;This very day you shall see the
mountain in all its glory. Here we can see only its
snow-capped crown, but on the way to Kamakura
there are wonderful views of our sacred Fuji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After breakfast there were great preparations for
the journey to Kamakura. First, each one in the
family, one after the other, had to take a hot bath.
Then the best kimonos were put on, and the best
paper parasols were taken out of a long box in
the godown.</p>

<p class="indent">One servant ran to order the jinrikishas to take
them to the station. Another packed rice, pickled
radishes, and tiny strips of raw fish into the lunch
boxes.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's mother was in every part of the house at
once, and even the grandmother seemed excited at
the thought of going to the seashore.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé ran across the garden to tell Tei about the
trip and bid her cousin sayonara, and Tara found
a box of his best fishhooks and tucked them into his
sleeve pocket.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;I may catch an eel,&quot; he said, &quot;and then we can
have it fried for our dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last the whole family were in the jinrikishas
and were whirled so fast to the station that they
had to wait a long time for the train.</p>

<p class="indent">The children were glad to stand on the platform,
watching the throngs of people and seeing the interesting
sights. Newsboys were running everywhere
calling their papers; strangely-dressed foreigners
were hiring jinrikisha-runners to take them
over the city; a police sergeant was walking up and
down; and electric cars were bringing passengers
to the station with much ringing of bells and clanging
of gongs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear Yuki-ko will not like her first ride in a
train,&quot; said Umé, as the child hid her face in her
mother's kimono at the sight of a big engine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I well remember my first sight of an engine,&quot;
said the grandmother. &quot;When I was a little girl
there was not a railroad track in all Japan. When
the first trains ran through the country, the peasant
women thought the engines were horrible demons,
and ran screaming away from the puffing and hissing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, too, remember the first engines,&quot; said the
father. &quot;Many were the honorably strange sights
that went with them. One morning a man took off
his clogs at this admirable station and set them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
with worthy care upon the platform before he entered
the train. It was his peaceful expectation to
find them waiting for him when he left the train
in Yokohama.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment an engine came puffing down the
track, and soon they were all seated in one of the
open cars and gliding swiftly out of the city.</p>

<p class="indent">The children pointed out to each other the lotus
blossoms in the moats, the little boats in the canal
and the freight boats on the Sumida river.</p>

<p class="indent">The father and mother talked about the tea-farms
and the fields of rice and millet through which they
were passing. Many crows flew cawing over the
heads of men and women who were working in the
deep mud of the rice fields.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty birds!&quot; called Baby San.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She means the white herons,&quot; said Tara. Dozens
of the long-legged herons were stalking about in
the muddy fields near the track; and farther away,
many pieces of white paper fluttered from strings
which were stretched across the fields of rice.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki San saw no difference between the birds and
the fluttering bits of white paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those small white ones scare the unworthy
crows away, little flower Sister,&quot; explained Tara;
but the baby sister shook her head and said, &quot;No,
pretty birds!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé turned the baby's head gently away from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
the fluttering scarecrows. &quot;Look at the pretty
flowers,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Beautiful lotus blossoms were growing in the
muddy ditches beside the track. The baby bobbed
her head to them and begged them to stand still,
but they all hurried past the hands she held out to
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The lotus is Buddha's flower,&quot; said O Ba
San. &quot;It grows out of the dirt and slime to give
us blossoms of rare beauty. Such may be the
growth of our hearts if we choke not their good
impulses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a long way from Buddha's flower to his
mountain,&quot; said Umé, as she looked off to where
Fuji rose in the distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it true,&quot; asked Tara, &quot;that on the days when
we cannot see the mountain through the mist, it
is because it has gone on a visit to the gardens of
the gods?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what I always thought when I was a
child,&quot; his grandmother answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And do many pilgrims every year climb the long
way up its steep sides to the top?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And must I also climb to the top some day, if
I wish to please the gods?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, unless the gods should honorably please
to take away your power to climb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
&quot;Oh,&quot; gasped Umé, &quot;I hope the gods will never
do that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked anxiously at her feet and said, &quot;I
hope they will never need my feet for anything.
So unworthily short a time have I used them, that
they cannot be fit for the gods.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let your use of them be always in the service
of the gods, and the more honorably old they grow,
the more favor will they find in the sight of the
gods,&quot; answered her grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">But Tara did not like such serious talk. &quot;How
does the earth get back on the mountain--the earth
that the pilgrims bring down every day on their
sandals?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is said that it goes back of itself by night,&quot;
his grandmother replied, and added, &quot;but I would
rather speak of the path of straw sandals which the
pilgrims leave behind them as they toil up the rough
sides of Fujiyama.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what do they do?&quot; asked Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They take many pairs with them, so that when
one pair is worn out they may have others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought the pilgrims were honorably
poor,&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always,&quot; said her grandmother. &quot;And
sandals cost but an insignificant sum. A pair may
be bought for a few rin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I will go myself, some time,&quot; said Umé,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
as if the only reason she had never been to the
mountain-top was because she had never known the
price of sandals.</p>

<p class="indent">But before they could say anything more they
were in Yokohama, where they were to leave the
train and ride in jinrikishas to Kamakura.</p>

<p class="indent">After they had left this city, with its busy streets,
its harbor dotted with boats and big foreign ships
riding at anchor, the road led along a bluff from
which there was a beautiful view of the bay.</p>

<p class="indent">It was intensely hot and the noonday sun beat
fiercely down upon them. Umé held a big paper
parasol carefully over her grandmother, and Tara
and his father waved their fans slowly back and
forth to catch the little breezes from the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">In the distance were green fields of rice, little
vegetable farms, tiny houses, low blue hills, and beyond
all, Fujiyama, rising majestically to the clear
blue sky.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fujiyama, the Sacred Mountain. <i>Page 69.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">As they were whirled past a little village they
heard a deep booming sound, and caught sight of an
immense drum under an open shed, which was being
beaten by two men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot; asked Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everywhere there has been no rain and the rice
is drying in the fields,&quot; replied his father, &quot;so
drums are beaten and prayers are made to the gods
that it may rain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
&quot;Water is truly desirable,&quot; said Tara. &quot;My unworthy
throat is this moment as dry as the rice
fields.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not far before us is a rocky pool shaded by ancient
pines,&quot; said his father. &quot;There pure august
water will be given.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rocky pool was a delightful resting-place.
The stone basin was filled with water by a spring
that leaped out of the heart of the cliff. The water
overflowed the basin and formed a stream which ran
along beside the road. Many travelers were sitting
on low benches under the pines, the men smoking
and the women and children chatting merrily.</p>

<p class="indent">Two women were washing clothes in the brook,
and Tara and his sisters slipped off their sandals
and white tabi, tucked up their kimonos and
splashed about in the water.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother took the food from the lunch boxes,
spread it on dainty paper napkins and called the
children to come and eat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Truly thanks for this honorable food,&quot; said
Umé, when she finished her luncheon. Then, as
she looked up at the spring, she added, &quot;The water
which comes from the cliff sings a happy little
song.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is like the spring of youth,&quot; said the grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Deign honorably to tell the story of the spring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
of youth,&quot; said the father, taking a pipe from his
sleeve pocket and filling its tiny bowl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Long ago a poor wood-cutter lived in a hut
in the forest with his old wife,&quot; said the grandmother.
&quot;Every day the old man went out to cut
wood and the woman stayed at home weaving.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One very hot day the old man wandered farther
than usual, looking for wood, and he suddenly
came to a little spring which he had never seen
before. The water was clear and cool and he was
very thirsty, so he knelt down and took a long
drink. It was so good that he was about to take
another--when he caught sight of his own face
in the water.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was not his own old face. It was the face
of a young man with black hair, smooth skin and
bright eyes. He jumped up, and discovered that he
no longer felt old. His arms were strong, his
feet were nimble and he could run like a boy. He
had found the Fountain of Youth and had been
made young again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First he leaped up and shouted for joy; then
he ran home faster than he had ever run before
in his life. His wife did not know him and was
frightened to see a stranger come running into the
house. When he told her the wonder she could
not at first believe him, but after a long time he
convinced her that the young man she now saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
standing before her was really her old husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course she wished to go at once to the
spring of youth and become as young as her husband,
so he told her where to find it in the forest
and she set out, leaving him at home to wait for
her return.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She found the spring and knelt down to drink.
The water was so cool and sweet that she drank
and drank, and then drank again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The husband waited a long time at home for
his wife to come back, changed into a pretty, slender
girl. But she did not come back at all, and at last
he became so anxious that he went into the forest
to find her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He went as far as the spring, but she was nowhere
to be seen. Just as he was about to go back
home again he heard a little cry in the grass near
the spring. Looking down he saw his wife's kimono
and a baby,--a very small baby, not more
than six months old.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old woman had drunk so much of the water
that she had been carried back beyond the time
of youth to that of infancy. The wood-cutter picked
the baby up in his arms, and it looked up at him
with a tiny smile. He carried it home, murmuring
to it and thinking sad thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The story was finished and the jinrikishas were
ready to take them on to Kamakura.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
&quot;I have heard so much about the wonderful
Buddha that I do not wish to see anything else in
Kamakura,&quot; said Umé, as they walked through the
grounds of the long-vanished temple.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no need to tell the children to walk
quietly and speak reverently before Buddha.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked up into the solemnly beautiful face,
into the half-closed eyes that seemed to watch her
through their eyelids of bronze, and knelt quietly
in prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing can harm the Great Buddha,&quot; said the
father, after the prayers had been said and the offering
given to the priest. &quot;Six hundred and fifty
years has he sat upon his throne. Once he was
sheltered by a temple, but centuries ago a tidal
wave, following an earthquake, swept away the
walls and roof and left the mighty god still seated
on his lotus-blossom throne.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Nothing can harm the Great Buddha.&quot; <i>Page 73.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">As they turned to walk toward the village Umé
said to her mother, &quot;When I have heard the thunder
I have always thought it was this Great Buddha,
very angry about something. Now that I have
seen his peaceful face I know it is not so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered her mother. &quot;Many thousands
of girls and boys have seen Great Buddha's face as
you saw it to-day. They have grown to be men
and women, and their children have looked upon his
face, but it is always calm and peaceful.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h3">THE ISLAND OF SHELLS</p>

<p class="indent">From Buddha's image at Kamakura to Enoshima,
the island of shells, there is first a ride in jinrikishas
through the low screen of hills that shuts the little
village away from the sea; then there is a walk
across the wet sands if the tide is out, or over
a light wooden bridge if the waves wash over the
path.</p>

<p class="indent">It was late in the afternoon when the jinrikisha men
trotted down from the hills through a deep-cut
path to the shore, and Umé could hear the slow
rollers breaking on the sands before she caught
her first glimpse of the lovely green island.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 518px;">
<a name="i_074" id="i_074"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_096.png" width="518" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;Umé caught her first Glimpse of the Lovely Green Island.&quot;
<i>Page 74.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The tide was coming in, but the water was still so
shallow that the children were permitted to take off
their sandals and tabi, and patter across the sands
in their bare feet, while the older people walked
slowly across the bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The sands were strewn with lovely shells, left by
the tide, and Baby Yuki soon had the sleeve pockets
of her kimono filled full of pearly beauties that
looked like peach blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara cared nothing for the shells. He spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
about the great tortoise which is said to live among
the caves of the island, and of the bronze dragons
which twisted around the gate through which they
passed to enter the long climbing street of the
town.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will ask the august father if we may visit the
cave of the dragon,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Japan must have been full of dragons once,&quot;
said Umé. &quot;Who killed them all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They turned into the honorable dragon-flies, to
drive away the mosquitoes,&quot; answered Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There have been no dragons seen alive in Japan
since the holy Buddha walked on the mountain,&quot;
said his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell us about it, please,&quot; begged Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Long ago,&quot; began the father, &quot;as Shaka Sama,
our most holy Buddha, walked on the mountain-top
at eventime, he looked into the depths below and
saw there the great dragon who knew the meaning
of all things. Shaka Sama asked him many questions
and to them all he received wise answers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Finally he asked the sacred question which he
most wished to understand; but the dragon replied
that, before revealing this last great mystery, he
must first be fed for his endless hunger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shaka Sama promised to give himself to the
dragon after he should have been told this great
truth. Then the dragon uttered the sacred mystery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
and the god threw himself into the abyss as
he had promised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But just as the fearful jaws were about to close
over the holy man, the dragon was changed into a
great eight-petaled lotus flower which held the
Buddha up in its cup and bore him back to his place
on the mountain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought there was a dragon in the cave at
Enoshima to guard Benten Sama's temple,&quot; said
Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no need of a dragon on the island,&quot;
said her father. &quot;The fisher boys who pray to her
for good fortune make faithful guardians of her
temple.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it to help the fisher boys on sea, as well as unworthy
little girls on land, that she has so many
arms?&quot; asked Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">But her father was leading the way along the
rough street of the beautiful island, and did not
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Enoshima seems to be the home of all the shells in
Japan. They lie heaped in all the houses and
shops; shells as white and lustrous as moonlight,
as rosy as dawn, as delicate as a baby's fingers.
There are thousands and thousands of them piled
together like the fallen petals of the pink cherry
blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">The street is lined on each side with tea-houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
and little shops, and in every one may be seen miracles
of shell-work. There are strings of mother-of-pearl
fishes, of mother-of-pearl birds, tiny kittens,
and foxes and dogs. There are mother-of-pearl
storks and beetles and butterflies, crabs and lobsters,
and bees made of shell poised on the daintiest
of shell flowers, and there are necklaces, pins and
hairpins in a hundred shapes.</p>

<p class="indent">Baby Yuki went about with her head bent to one
side, holding her ear to the mouth of the largest
shells, wherever she could find them. Deep in their
pink chambers she could hear the sound of the sea,
and the dull roar pleased her. After listening to
each one she would look up into her mother's face
with a happy smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Their father bought ornaments for the children,
a necklace of wee, shimmering, mother-of-pearl
fishes for the baby, a tortoise of pearl-shell for
which Tara begged, and a spray of shell flowers
for Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">For Tara he bought also a glass cup blown double,
with a tiny shell in the liquid between the
glass. Of course it was soon broken and, after
they had climbed the steep steps to the temples and
prayed to Benten Sama in her own island home,
they went back to the shops and bought another.</p>

<p class="indent">Afterwards they sat upon the rocks and watched
the tide flow in from the sea. Over the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
skimmed the white sails of returning boats; the
dragon's light, which we call phosphorescence,
played at the edge of the waves, and there was no
sound save that of the evening bells.</p>

<p class="indent">The twilight fell, making a gray sky in which
rode a silver crescent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Lady Moon,&quot; whispered Umé, and she
joined her little hands, bent her head, and gave
the prayer of welcome to O Tsuki Sama.</p>

<p class="indent">The father broke the stillness at last by telling
the story of the famous warrior, Yoritomo, who
made Kamakura a famous city hundreds of years
ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Kamakura has been burned these many
years,&quot; he said. &quot;People come here now only to
see Great Buddha and Enoshima.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Umé, &quot;I came for something else.
I came to ask Benten Sama for something which I
very much wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé shut her lips together and shook her
head that she would not tell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you afraid she would not hear you anywhere
but in her own temple?&quot; he asked again.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé nodded her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will surely find out what it was that you
asked from her,&quot; said Tara mischievously.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara usually did find out Umé's little secrets in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
some way, either by making fun or by teasing her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Maru San has put an honorable stillness upon
her august tongue,&quot; he would say with a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Maru San&quot; means &quot;Honorable Miss
Round,&quot; and when Tara said it, Umé knew he was
making fun of her.</p>

<p class="indent">Little Japanese girls and boys do not like to be
ridiculed. So, when Tara spoke that way, it usually
ended in Umé's saying, &quot;Don't call me that
name, Tara. My secret was only about the tea-party
that Tei and I are going to have in the
garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And soon Tara would know just what kind of
cakes they were going to have; because in Japan
the cakes are made to suit the season, if one wishes
to have an elaborate party.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, although it says in the book of &quot;The
Greater Learning for Women,&quot; that at the age of
seven, boys and girls must not sit on the same mat
nor eat at the same table, Tara was often invited
to Umé's tea-parties.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, although they stayed all night at the inn
at Enoshima and there was plenty of time to find
out Umé's secret, she did not tell it, and Tara
finally concluded that it was something more important
than a tea-party.</p>

<p class="indent">In the early morning they stood once more upon
the seashore, to watch the sun rise out of the ocean.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
The children forgot everything else in looking at
the beautiful sight. &quot;It is like our noble flag!&quot;
said Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">Japan is called &quot;The Land of the Rising Sun,&quot;
and the emblem of the country is a round red
sun on a white ground.</p>

<p class="indent">The children long remembered the beauty of that
morning. In front of them the great sun rose in a
cloudless sky; behind them Fuji lifted his noble
head, and the blue sea stretched on either side
as far as they could see.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the father said, &quot;We will return to
Tokio, to-day. We have had a pleasant and honorable
holiday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish first to find some of the intelligent crabs
that make straight tracks by crawling sideways,&quot;
said Tara. He had seen in the tea-house at
Enoshima some wonderful crabs, and hoped to find
one for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I wish to buy return gifts for Tei and
Baby Onda in the shops!&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">So while Tara hunted for crabs after breakfast,
Umé and her mother hunted for gifts.</p>

<p class="indent">The little boy found no large crabs; neither did
he find any good place to fish for eels, but Umé
found a lovely pearly necklace for Tei, and a pink
shell for Onda.</p>

<p class="indent">In her eagerness to reach home and show the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
gifts, she gave little thought to the beautiful sights
to be seen from the train.</p>

<p class="indent">She heard her grandmother say, &quot;There are
some fine young bamboo saplings. They would
look well beside the gate-pine-tree at New Year
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She heard Tara ask, &quot;Why are they used in the
gateway arch?&quot; and her grandmother answered,
&quot;Because they stand for constancy and honesty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will ask Benten Sama constantly for my wish
to be fulfilled,&quot; said Umé to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">When they reached home, she ran at once to find
Tei, but Tei had gone that very morning on a journey
to Nikko.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h3">A DAY IN SCHOOL</p>

<p class="indent">What country is it that starts its children off to
school very early in the morning? Japan, of
course, the island kingdom, &quot;The Land of the Rising
Sun,&quot;--and that is as it should be.</p>

<p class="indent">It was early in the &quot;hour of the hare,&quot; as time
would have been reckoned in the days of old Japan;
but the American clock in the kitchen said half-past
six, when Umé finished dressing for school.</p>

<p class="indent">She wore a plum-colored plaited skirt, with a
blue kimono tucked inside, and she said to her
mother, &quot;May I now go to the honorable lesson-learn
school, O Haha San?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was plenty of time between half-past six
and seven o'clock for her to reach the school building
and be in line with the other children when they
greeted the teacher.</p>

<p class="indent">But all the other little girls were bending up
and down in their greeting to the teacher when
Umé at last slipped into her place among them.
She said her happy &quot;Ohayo!&quot; just after the other
lips were all closed upon the &quot;good-morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
She whispered to Tei as they slipped into their
seats, &quot;We must eat our unworthy lunches together.
I have brought a bad piece of pickled
radish for you. It was because I ran back to the
dirty house for it that I was honorably late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese people are all alike! When they
mean one thing they say another. Umé really
meant that their lunch was delicious; that her
pickled radish was the best to be had in Tokio;
and her house the sweetest and cleanest in the
world; but it would have been very bad manners to
say so; and to be late to school is not at all honorable
in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">But Japan is a country where the people do everything
in an original way. The carpenter pulls his
saw toward him when he saws, and the planer pulls
his plane toward him when he planes a board.
Everybody sits down to work, and the horse goes
into the stall tail first.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese school children can never understand
how the English children can make sense out
of books that one reads from left to right and
from the top to the bottom of the page.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's teacher read the lesson aloud and the
children read it after her. They read from the
bottom to the top of the page, from right to
left, and from the end of the book to the beginning.</p>

<p class="indent">From seven until twelve o'clock the children were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
busy with their lessons and recitations, stopping to
eat their lunches in the middle of the forenoon, and
for a short recess at the end of every hour.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé loved to go to school. Tara always said,
&quot;It is because I am obliged to, that I go to school,&quot;
but Umé knew that her school-days were the happiest
she would have for many years. After they
were over, she would go to her husband's house
and take the lowest place in his family, as is the
custom of Japanese maidens.</p>

<p class="indent">Before that time she must learn to sew, cook and
direct the servants in every household duty; she
must also learn the tea-ceremony and the ceremony
of flower arrangement.</p>

<p class="indent">All these things she learns, as well as reading,
writing and music.</p>

<p class="indent">The tea-ceremony, which sounds so simple, is
a very old and difficult one. Every position of the
one who conducts it, as well as that of the bowl,
spoon, tea-caddy and towel, is regulated by rule.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowls are used instead of teapots, and tea powder
instead of tea leaves. There is a sweeping of the
room at the right time, and a walking out into the
garden at another right time. Oh, it is not so
simple as it sounds!</p>

<p class="indent">The ceremony of arranging flowers is also very
hard to learn. People who have learned it thoroughly
are said to have charming dispositions as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
reward of merit. They are gentle, self-controlled,
peaceful-hearted and always at ease in the presence
of their superiors, besides having many other
virtues.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé enjoyed it all. Everything she did was
prettily and gracefully done. Whether she bent
over a difficult, unruly spray of blossoms, or over
her writing brush to make the difficult characters,
her sweet oval face was never clouded.</p>

<p class="indent">After the writing lesson was over on this opening
day, she took her copy book, which was soggy with
much India ink and water, and beckoned Tei to
take hers also into the yard. There they spread
the books in the sun to dry.</p>

<p class="indent">Tei's family had been away for a month for the
sake of Baby Onda's health, and the two little
girls had not seen each other until now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you see at Nikko?&quot; asked Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We saw the most beautiful building in Japan;
the tomb of the great Iyeyasu,&quot; answered Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I also was at Nikko and played with Tei in the
temple yard,&quot; said a third child who overheard
their talk.</p>

<p class="indent">The three little girls walked back to the school-room
together and Umé said, &quot;I have asked my
mother to take me to Nikko some time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are beautiful temples there,&quot; said Tei.
&quot;The mad pony of the illustrious Iyeyasu is there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
in a stable which has wonderful carvings over the
doorway. It was there we saw the three monkeys
your honorable mother spoke about one day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé drew her breath in a long sigh. &quot;I have
always wished to see those monkeys,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After you have seen them,&quot; said Tei, &quot;you
will never again wish to see evil, hear evil, nor speak
evil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little girls drew away from one another and
fell into the three positions. They made a cunning
picture as they stood, Umé with her fingers over
her ears, Tei with her mouth covered, and the third
little girl covering her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher stood in the doorway and smiled--&quot;The
little dumb monkey, the little deaf monkey,
and the monkey that will not see any evil!&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">The three little monkeys bowed to the ground
and ran laughing for their lunch boxes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think Tara is doing in his school
this minute?&quot; asked Tei, as they began eating rice-cakes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is perhaps having military drill,&quot; said Umé.
&quot;Or he maybe is hearing about Iyeyasu; that
when he went into battle he wore a handkerchief
over his head, but after the victory he put on his
helmet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tei sighed. &quot;I wish there were not so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
things to learn about our great heroes,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé laughed. &quot;Let not the honorable teacher
hear you say such a thing,&quot; she said, &quot;else we shall
have another history book given us, with the example
of brave and loyal Japanese women to read
in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No country in the world has so many books of
history for the children to learn as Japan. It was
not strange that Tei sometimes found it wearisome.
There was all the history of Old Japan to be
learned, as well as all about the New Japan, and
even Umé was never sorry when the noon hour arrived
and they were dismissed from school.</p>

<p class="indent">They bowed low to the teacher, and the teacher
bowed low to them, and they clattered toward home
with a great chattering of soft voices.</p>

<p class="indent">But the voices were all hushed when Umé told
her playmates that she had visited Benten Sama's
temple at Enoshima in the time of great heat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Umé! what favor did you ask of the dear
goddess?&quot; asked Tei.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé shook her head, as she had done when
Tara asked her the same question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will wait and see if she grants it to me before
I tell it to any one,&quot; she said, and opened her pretty
paper parasol.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h3">YUKI SAN IN THE STREET OF SHOPS</p>

<p class="indent">Asakusa Temple and its beautiful grounds are in
the eastern part of the city of Tokio.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinrikisha runners could cover the distance between
the Utsuki house and Asakusa Temple in fifteen
or twenty minutes, but Baby Yuki was two
hours on the way, because she toddled along so
slowly and stopped so often to watch the children
who were playing in the streets.</p>

<p class="indent">The baby slipped quietly out of the house while
her mother was having her honorable hair dressed.
It takes a hair-dresser about two hours to dress a
Japanese lady's honorable hair, but fortunately it
has to be done only once in five or six days because
the hair is never mussed at night.</p>

<p class="indent">The women in Japan keep their heads peacefully
quiet all night, letting their necks only rest upon
the thin cushion of their wooden pillow. In this
way the soft rolls and puffs of their shining black
hair are not disturbed, and even the big pins do not
have to be removed.</p>

<p class="indent">Hair-dressers go from house to house as often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
as they are needed, and when Baby Yuki saw one
come into the room and begin taking down her
mother's hair, she began quietly taking her way
along the stepping stones to the gate. Once outside
the gate she trotted along toward the bridge over
the moat.</p>

<p class="indent">This moat ran around the old feudal castle where
a daimyo used to live, and Yuki-ko often went as
far as the bridge with Umé or Tara when they
started off for school. Sometimes all three of the
children went there to look at the green lotus leaves
or the beautiful lotus blossoms which cover the
water in July and August.</p>

<p class="indent">But to-day Baby Yuki did not stop on the bridge.
She crossed it and clattered down the street to a
far corner where a street-peddler was selling toys.</p>

<p class="indent">Japanese peddlers are always very pleasant people,
and this one danced and sang funny songs
which the baby was only too glad to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">Up one street and down another the man took
his way, stopping wherever he found a few little
children to listen to him; and one or two children
from every group followed along with Yuki San,
making a pretty sight.</p>

<p class="indent">A foreign lady with a camera stopped her jinrikisha-man,
saying, &quot;That is the very smallest child
I ever saw standing on its own two feet and walking
with other children in the street. One of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
older girls should carry the baby on her back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Baby Yuki stood on the outside of the group,
making a pretty picture all by herself. She was so
clean and sweet that the lady determined to follow
her and take several pictures. She dismissed
her jinrikisha and became a child with the others,
following where the peddler led.</p>

<p class="indent">At last they reached Asakusa street, which
leads to Asakusa Temple. This street is lined with
booths on each side, and in each booth there is a
man selling toys, or candies, or paper parasols, or
kites, or something to tempt the rin and sen out of
a child's pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">Wherever there is a temple in a Japanese city
there is also a toy-shop, and where there is a toy-shop
there is, of course, a toy which one must
surely buy. The children love to buy the toys and
play with them in the temple gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">In the gardens of Asakusa Temple there are
ponds filled with goldfish and silverfish and carp.
These fish are tame and will eat from the children's
fingers because children have fed them for years
and years.</p>

<p class="indent">Just outside the gateway to the temple, old
women sit beside little tables and sell saucers full
of food for the fishes in the ponds and the doves
that live in the temple eaves. And where one person
sells anything many other people also sell something.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
They sell, the children buy, and the doves
and fishes are fed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is like the 'House that Jack Built,'&quot; said the
American lady. &quot;This is the pond that held the
fish, that ate the cakes, that lay in the dish and
were sold in the booths with all kinds of toys, from
dolls to kites, for girls and boys.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 520px;">
<a name="i_091" id="i_091"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_114.png" width="520" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">The Street of Shops and Asakusa Temple. <i>Page 91.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It does not take the little street of shops a long
time to reach the temple steps, in Asakusa; but
it does take the little people a long time to get
through the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Baby Yuki stopped to kotow to the first old
woman she saw selling beans. In that moment the
toy-peddler and all the children seemed to disappear.
The baby looked around for them, and was
frightened to find that she was all alone.</p>

<p class="indent">But before she had time to realize that she was
lost, the foreign lady had bought beans from the old
woman and poured them into the baby's hands, and
the doves were flying down to pick up the beans as
she scattered them in the street.</p>

<p class="indent">From feeding the doves it was but a step to other
joys. The lady bought a paper parasol at one of
the booths, at another a doll and a Japanese
lantern on the end of a slender bamboo stick. She
tied the doll to the baby's back, tilted the parasol
over her shoulder, gave her the lantern to hold,
and took her picture.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
Then she took the child's hand and they walked
along together until they came to an old woman
who sat on the ground holding a tray of paper
flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady stopped to buy some of the flowers, and
might have gone on buying gifts--for there was
no end to the toys for sale in that short street--but
the paper flowers had to be opened in a bowl
of water.</p>

<p class="indent">To find the bowl of water the big lady and the
little girl had to pass under the temple gate and
walk off among the trees and fish-ponds till they
came to a tea-house. There they sat down to rest,
and a maid brought tea and cakes for them to eat,
and a bowl of water for the flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">There are always picnics going on in the grounds
of the temple, especially at chrysanthemum time;
but there was never a prettier picnic sight than the
one made by Yuki-ko San and her foreign friend
as they knelt on the mats, sipping their tea, and
watching the tiny paper flowers change into all
sorts of shapes.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the flowers became beautiful potted
plants, about an inch tall. Others changed into
trees, or birds, and one even took the shape of Fujiyama,
the lofty mountain. They seemed like fairy
trees and birds, and not until the last one had
opened did Yuki San lift her little face from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
bowl of water. Then she spoke for the first time.
&quot;Yuki take little birds home to O Chichi San,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy! the child is lost and I don't know how
to find her people,&quot; said the foreign lady. But the
maid who served the cakes said, &quot;She must have
a name-label around her neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately she had, and not only the street
where she lived, but also the street and number
of her father's shop, was written on it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was so far to either place that the lady said
very sensibly, &quot;We will take a carriage.&quot; So she
called a jinrikisha-man, and off they went to the
father's shop.</p>

<p class="indent">At a little distance from the silk shop, where the
father sat waiting for customers, the lady stopped
her runner and put the little girl down upon the
ground. &quot;Run to your O Chichi San,&quot; she said,
pointing to the shop, and then she watched the baby
to see if she found the right father.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime someone else was hurrying to
find her father. It was Umé, who had been sent
with one of the maids to tell the sad news that
Baby Yuki had wandered away from home and
was surely lost.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as Umé reached the silk shop and poured out
her story, who should toddle along with her hands
full of toys, dropping one and then another as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
she kotowed her fat little body over them, but the
baby herself.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course there was much talk, and many questions
were asked of her; but the child could only
say that &quot;Haha San with many hands&quot; had given
her the toys and brought her to her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was Benten Sama,&quot; said Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">It is well known that Benten Sama has eight
hands, and who but Benten Sama would give Baby
Yuki so many lovely gifts and bring her safely
through the city streets to her father's shop?</p>

<p class="indent">As they took the baby home to her frightened
mother, Umé said softly to her father, &quot;Yuki-ko
San did as much in finding you as Fishsave did
when he found his father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And her father answered, &quot;The tie between
fathers and children is honorably strong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé was already thinking that probably
Benten Sama would answer her prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">As they passed the foreign lady, who was still
sitting in her jinrikisha at the corner of the street,
Umé looked longingly at the tan-colored shoes she
was wearing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Red ones with black heels are prettier,&quot; she
said to herself.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE EMPEROR'S BIRTHDAY</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let the Emperor live forever!&quot; sang Umé, on
the third day of the eleventh month.</p>

<p class="indent">This day is the Emperor's birthday, and all loyal
Japanese pray that their ruler may see the chrysanthemum
cup go round, autumn after autumn, for a
thousand years.</p>

<p class="indent">Autumn is the loveliest month of all the year in
Japan. Then the maples put on their glorious
crimson and orange colors, and the chrysanthemums
fling out their beautiful many-colored petals to the
sun.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese say that the maples are the crimson
clouds that hang about the sunset of their flower
life.</p>

<p class="indent">From February until November different flowers
reign, one after another, for a few short weeks.
First comes the plum blossom, about which everyone
writes a poem. Next the great double cherry
blossoms make the island look like a lovely pink
cobweb on the blue sea. After that, wistaria blossoms,
five or six feet long, hang from trellises and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
flutter in the breeze; and so on, until at last the
chrysanthemum, the royal flower, says &quot;Sayonara,&quot;
and the sun of the flower-year has set.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The last flower is honorably the best,&quot; said
Umé, as she hovered over the masses of color in
the garden-beds.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked like a beautiful blossom herself in
her blue silk kimono. Chrysanthemums in deep
golden brown and palest pink were embroidered in
the silk. Her undergarment of pink showed at the
throat; and about her waist was a pink sash embroidered
with blue.</p>

<p class="indent">That sash was Umé's delight. It was tied in an
immense bow behind, and Tara had never been
able to find the ends that he might pull them out
and so tease his sister a little.</p>

<p class="indent">On her feet Umé wore black lacquer clogs and
white stockings, with the great toe in a room by
itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Her hair was carefully drawn up to the top of
her head, where it was tied with a broad piece of
blue crêpe, and then formed into several puffs at
the back. A brilliant pink chrysanthemum pin was
stuck through the puffs in one direction and a butterfly
pin in the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's pins and sashes were her dearest treasures!</p>

<p class="indent">The finishing touch was given to her face and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
lips. Rice powder made her skin look very white,
and a touch of paint made her cheeks and mouth
very red, although they were quite red enough before.</p>

<p class="indent">Her mother was wholly pleased with Umé's appearance,
but Umé shook her head over the clogs;
she wished for something different.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is time to make the honorable start to the
gardens, Umé-ko!&quot; called her mother at last, and
the little girl left the flowers and took her seat in
the waiting jinrikisha.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé was going with her mother, first to make
an offering at the temple, then to look at the flowers
in the gardens at Dango-Zaka.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara was going with his father to see the Emperor
review the troops.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki San was not forgotten. She was going
with her grandmother to play in the gardens at
Asakusa once more.</p>

<p class="indent">All wore their festival clothes, as was proper on
the Emperor's birthday.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara and his father wore kimonos, but they were
much darker in color than Umé's; their sashes were
narrower, and there were no bows in the back.</p>

<p class="indent">Yuki-ko was the really gorgeous one. Her kimono
was of bright red silk, her sash pale yellow.
A gold embroidered pocket hung from the sash and
in the pocket she carried a charm to keep her safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
from harm in case something happened to her name-label.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;honorable start&quot; was made at last and the
three jinrikisha coolies dashed through the gate,
one behind the other, Tara and his father in the
lead.</p>

<p class="indent">A fuzzy caterpillar was humping his way along
the road outside the gate. The three runners
turned aside and left a large part of the road to
the caterpillar, although so much room was more
than the fuzzy creature needed. The men thought
that perhaps the soul of an ancestor might be in
the little insect, and they feared to crush it.</p>

<p class="indent">The city was in its gayest holiday attire. Red
and white Japanese flags adorned every house. Men
dressed in uniform were hurrying through the
streets, soldiers were marching toward the parade
grounds, and there were crowds of happy people
everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">After riding over the wooden bridge Tara and
his father took their way to the Emperor's review,
while the other two jinrikishas turned toward Asakusa
Temple.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé sat up very straight, making herself as tall
as possible, and said, as she watched her father
being whirled down the street, &quot;My son, it is now
my unworthy privilege--&quot; then stopped, because
her mother looked at her in reproof.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;It is my unworthy privilege to remind you that
respectful children do not thus mimic their parents
in voice and word,&quot; said her mother gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will ask to be forgiven when we are in the
temple,&quot; said Umé penitently.</p>

<p class="indent">She was still serious when she dropped a rin into
the grated box that waits always for offerings in
the temples.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I write a prayer to the goddess Kwannon?&quot;
she asked, as the coin clinked against others
in the box.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there something you very much desire, Umé-ko?&quot;
asked her mother with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé nodded. &quot;There is something I have asked
from every one of the gods and goddesses you have
ever told me about,&quot; she said. &quot;I have been asking
for it constantly ever since my last plum-blossom
birthday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kwannon is the goddess of mercy; perhaps
she will be merciful to you and grant your wish,
whatever it may be,&quot; said her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">So Umé wrote her wish on a slip of paper and
hung it where hundreds of other prayers were
hanging on a lattice in front of a shrine.</p>

<p class="indent">Afterwards she went with her mother to the corner
where the god Binzuru was waiting to cure any
sort of disease.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's mother had an ache in her back. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
rubbed her hand gently over the back of the god
and then tried to rub her own back; but it was not
easy to reach between her shoulders and rub the
pain away. After she finished reaching, her back
ached more than before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will go to the gardens at Dango-Zaka;
there we shall forget our aches in looking at the
lovely flowers,&quot; she told Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">Baby Yuki was already feeding the goldfish and
did not care whether her mother stayed at Asakusa
Temple or not.</p>

<p class="indent">So the two rode away through the city streets
toward the district of Dango-Zaka. Sometimes
they mounted a hill from which they could look
over the city and see the flags fluttering in the
breeze; sometimes they crossed a canal crowded with
heavily-laden scows; sometimes they passed through
business streets where people sat in their houses or
shops with the front walls all open to the sidewalk.
The people sat and worked, or ate their lunch, or
sold their wares, as if they were all a part of one
great family with the people in the streets and
had no secrets from them.</p>

<p class="indent">Wells and water-tanks stood at convenient
distances along the streets, and from their jinrikishas
Umé and her mother saw crowds of women
washing rice and chatting with one another as they
worked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
At the chrysanthemum gardens there were many
little gates, at each one of which Umé paid four
sen before they could enter and look at the flowers
in living pictures.</p>

<p class="indent">The gardeners in Japan make all sorts of wonderful
stories and pictures with the chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class="indent">Here you will see a ship filled with gods and
goddesses. There you will be astonished at the
sight of a sail set to carry a junk over a chrysanthemum
sea. Somewhere else you will come upon
an open umbrella, a flag, a demon or a dragon;
there is no end to the quaint fancies!</p>

<p class="indent">It is hard to understand how these pictures can be
made until one learns that the gardeners have been
at the business for several generations. They say
that, to have a thing well done, your children and
grandchildren must do it after you.</p>

<p class="indent">To make the chrysanthemum pictures, they tie
the branches of the plants, and even the tiny flowers,
to slender bamboo sticks; there is also a delicate
frame of copper wire through which the flowers are
sometimes drawn, and sometimes the gardeners use
light bamboo figures of boats and dragons and
gods.</p>

<p class="indent">The faces of the people in the flower pictures
are paper or plaster masks. It would really be too
much to ask the gardeners to make chrysanthemum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
expressions. Nowhere outside of Japan will you
find such curious pictures!</p>

<p class="indent">It was very late when Umé and her mother
reached home again. Now the houses on both
sides of the streets were hung with festoons of
flags and lanterns on each of which was the round
red sun of Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">The wide-opened shutters showed brightly
lighted rooms in which the families were entertaining
friends or having tea and cakes; they sat on
the floors, which were covered with scarlet blankets
in honor of the Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">In the shops were tempting displays of fruits,
fish and toys, and in the distance Umé could see
the fireworks which were being set off in the palace
grounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara and his father were already at home, but
the boy was far too excited over the grand review
of the Emperor's troops to listen to anything his
sister had to tell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is an honorably wonderful man, our most
illustrious Emperor,&quot; said Tara. &quot;My admirable
father told me that he never stood upon his own
feet until he was sixteen years old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that is not so honorably wonderful,&quot;
said Umé stoutly. But when she took both of her
own feet up at the same time, to try how it could
be done, she found herself suddenly upon the floor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;Did he walk upon his august head?&quot; she demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Umé,&quot; said her mother, &quot;speak not so disrespectfully
of the Son of Heaven!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Tara explained: &quot;He was carried about
all the time, and shown only to very noble people
once in a while. But when he became a man, he
said it should all be different. And he put down
all the old nobility that had kept him so honorably
helpless, and then he made everything as it is to-day
in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Under the old rule, no one was allowed to
leave the country and we knew no other people
except the Chinese. Now we know the whole
world and can teach the other nations many
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then old Maru entered the room with tea
and cakes. The cakes looked exactly like maple
leaves. There were also candies made to look like
autumn grasses and chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé clapped her hands and danced about the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May the Emperor live forever!&quot; she sang; and
Tara wheeled and marched like a soldier, shouting,
&quot;May Japan never be conquered!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h3">DARUMA SAMA</p>

<p class="indent">Among the stories which O Ba San told to Umé
and her brother was one about Daruma Sama.</p>

<p class="indent">Daruma Sama was a Japanese saint who lived
many, many years ago. It was his great desire
to cross the sea on a leaf, but in order to do so it
was first necessary for him to pray long and sincerely
to the gods.</p>

<p class="indent">He knelt in prayer for many years, and at last his
feet and legs fell from his body because they had
been idle so long a time.</p>

<p class="indent">In all the toy-shops there are images of this
saint with his large head and big round body which
has no trouble in sitting still.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese children make their snow men in
the image of Daruma Sama. They give him a
charcoal ball for each eye and a streak of charcoal
for his nose and mouth, and then they have a fine
snow man.</p>

<p class="indent">It was almost the end of the year before Tara
had an opportunity to make a Daruma. In Tokio
snow rarely covers the ground for more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
twenty-four hours at a time, and sometimes there
is a winter with almost no snow at all.</p>

<p class="indent">But one evening, only two days before the New
Year Festival, the air was so chilly that the veranda
shutters were all tightly closed and the shoji drawn
together, while the family sat around the fireplace.</p>

<p class="indent">Lift up the square of matting in the middle of a
Japanese living-room and you will find, sunk in
the floor, a stone-lined bowl a few inches deep.
This is the fireplace. When the day is cold the
maid puts a shovelful of live coals into this bowl,
places a wooden frame about a foot high over it,
and covers all with a quilt. Then the cold ones
may sit around the fire on the floor, draw the quilt
over their knees and into their laps, and soon
become perfectly warm.</p>

<p class="indent">Tara and Umé had heard many a delightful story
as they sat snuggled under the warm quilt on winter
evenings.</p>

<p class="indent">On this evening their father said suddenly, &quot;The
white snow-flakes will fall to-night and cover the
earth as the white plum blossoms cover the trees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tara sprang from under the quilt and ran to open
the shutters so that he might see for himself how
the weather looked outside.</p>

<p class="indent">He was so eager that his fingers slipped and
pushed a hole through the paper covering of the
shoji. His mother looked sadly at the torn place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
&quot;It was only this morning,&quot; she said, &quot;that I put
new papers on the shoji to be in readiness for the
New Year. Baby Yuki's fingers had made many
holes in the paper walls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment Tara ran back into the warm room.
&quot;It is faithfully true,&quot;' he cried. &quot;Even now white
flakes are falling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning it was as if they had moved to a
different world. The snow made the garden, with
its trees and pond and bridge, look like fairyland.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will go to the garden-house for my stilts,&quot;
said Tara, &quot;then I can walk about in the snow on
my heron-legs as the white herons walk in the
mud of the rice-fields.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stilts are made of bamboo sticks, and are called
&quot;heron-legs,&quot; after the long-legged snowy herons
that strut about in the wet fields. Wooden clogs
will lift their wearers out of the mud of the streets
in bad weather; but the boys are always glad of an
excuse to get out their stilts. They walk on them so
much that they become expert in their use and can
run and even play games on them.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked rather sadly at the new white world
outside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The snow has come too soon,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Tara.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I have no time for play,&quot; answered
Umé. &quot;There are gifts to finish, and I must also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
help the honorable mother to make all clean and
sweet for the New Year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let the gifts honorably wait until the hour of
the horse,&quot; said Tara, &quot;so that you may play with
us this morning in the garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé went dutifully to her sewing. She was
making a bundle handkerchief for Tei out of a piece
of bright colored crêpe with her family crest embroidered
on it.</p>

<p class="indent">After that was finished she made a lucky-bag to
hang on the New Year's arch at the house door.</p>

<p class="indent">The lucky-bag was made of a square of Japanese
paper. Into it Umé put several things which are
known to bring good luck--a few chestnuts, a bit
of dried fish, and a dried plum. She tied them up
in the paper with a red and white paper string, and
put the bag away until the arch should be ready.</p>

<p class="indent">New Year's Day is the most important time in
the whole year in Japan. It is the day when all
the people, from the highest to the lowest, have a
holiday. For days, and even weeks, preparations
are made to celebrate the festival with proper ceremony.
Never are the streets of the cities and
towns so filled with gayly dressed crowds of people
hurrying here and there, buying and selling, as
during the last days of the dying year.</p>

<p class="indent">Every house is thoroughly cleaned from roof to
veranda, the shoji are covered with fresh papers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
new kimonos and sashes are made, new hairpins
purchased, new mats are laid on the floors and the
old ones are burned.</p>

<p class="indent">On the last day of the old year every room is
dusted with the feathery leaves of a green branch of
bamboo. Then the gateway is decorated with a
beautiful arch, one of the Japanese symbols of
health, happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p class="indent">On each side of the gateway two holes are dug
in which are planted small pine trees. On the left
is the tree which represents the father, on the right
is the mother-pine. Beside these are set the graceful
stems of the bamboo, the green leaves towering
above the low roof and rustling in the wind. From
one bamboo stalk to the other is hung a thick rope
of rice-straw, beautifully plaited and knotted, to give
a blessing to the household and keep out all evil
spirits.</p>

<p class="indent">From this rope hang yellow oranges, and scarlet
lobsters which with their crooked bodies signify
long life and an old age bent with years. There
are also fern leaves, a branch of camellia, a piece of
seaweed, a lucky-bag, flags, and strips of white
paper which are supposed to be images of men
offering themselves to the gods.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything about the pine-tree arch has a meaning,
and signifies wishes for health, strength, happiness,
obedience, honor and a long life.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
Of course there must be a decoration inside the
house as well. Tara and Umé went to the shops
with their father to choose one for the alcove room,
after the Daruma Sama was made and Umé's
sewing finished.</p>

<p class="indent">The children chose a harvest ship, a junk about
two feet long, made of straw with twigs of pine
and bamboo in the bow and stern. It was loaded
with many bales of make-believe merchandise in
which were little gifts, and was sprinkled with
gold-dust to make it look bright. There was a red
sun on one side of the boat and the sails were of
scarlet paper.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way home they passed a shop where
foreign shoes were offered for sale, and where
some one at that moment was buying a pair of red
shoes for a little girl about as old as Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé held her father still to watch the child try
them on her little feet, and they certainly made the
feet look very pretty.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé's father smiled at the look in his daughter's
eyes, but he soon drew her away to a toy-shop out
of sight of the little red shoes. There they bought
a ball for Baby Yuki and gifts for the mother and
grandmother, going home only when they could
carry nothing more.</p>

<p class="indent">If ever there is a time and place when enticing
red shoes can be forgotten, it is New Year's time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
among the shops in Japan. No one ever thinks of
staying indoors then, else he would miss the gayest,
liveliest, brightest time of the whole year.</p>

<p class="indent">The shop-keepers have to fill their shelves with
great quantities of new things to match the New
Year; there are new games, new kimonos, new
clogs, new toys for sale everywhere, and even the
story-tellers brighten up their old stories to make
them seem like new.</p>

<p class="indent">That last day before the New Year was a very
busy one in the Utsuki household. There were gifts
to be put into dainty packages, the pine-tree arch to
be decorated, the last stitches to be taken in the
new kimonos, and the last bills to be paid--even
the smallest one that might possibly have been
overlooked.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a beautiful custom in Japan of beginning
the year without a debt. Every bill is paid and no
one owes a single sen when the old year dies and
the new year dawns.</p>

<p class="indent">When at last Umé said her honorable good-night
to her father and mother and went to her wooden
pillow she was very tired.</p>

<p class="indent">As she crept under the warm coverlet she whispered
drowsily, &quot;May Benten Sama, or Kwannon,
or one of the illustrious goddesses give me what I
have prayed for so long.&quot; Then she fell fast asleep.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h3">NEW YEAR'S DAY</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So many honorable sounds!&quot; murmured Umé
drowsily, and she listened for a moment without
opening her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">It was New Year's morning, so early that the sun
was only just rising.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé could hear the clapping of many hands
outside the house. &quot;I, myself, meant to welcome
the illustrious sun with the hand-joy,&quot; she said to
herself, and sprang from her bed with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">It took but a moment to slip into a thick kimono
and push open the shoji. Someone had already
opened the wooden shutters and Umé reached the
corner of the street in time to see the round red sun
send his first beams over the snow-covered roofs.</p>

<p class="indent">She clapped her hands joyously and bowed a welcoming
&quot;Ohayo&quot; to the great ball of light. &quot;Now
I shall surely begin the year with good luck!&quot; she
said to herself as she slipped back into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">She closed the shoji and cuddled again between
the soft quilts for warmth. Then it occurred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
her to wonder why she had not seen her mother, who
always rose very early, among the group that was
greeting the New Year sun.</p>

<p class="indent">The air was filled with the sound of joy bells
which were ringing from all the temples. One
hundred and eight strokes must they ring, twelve
times nine, to keep all evil spirits away from the
city in this new year.</p>

<p class="indent">But there were other sounds which came from
within the house. Was it,--yes, it surely was the
sound of a little new baby's cry.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Umé was out of bed and pattering across
the room to open her shoji. Her father was standing
before the alcove in the honorable guest room,
and he read the question in her face before Umé
could ask it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;a new son has come to our
unworthy house on this morning of the New Year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé bowed her forehead to the floor, &quot;Omedeto,
O Chichi San,&quot; she said. &quot;I am most respectfully
happy. May I go to see him and bid him honorable
welcome?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After the breakfast is faithfully eaten, it may
perhaps be permitted,&quot; answered her father. Then
he asked, &quot;Was there not some gift you have asked
from the gods in the year that has passed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have asked many times for a gift, but neither
the gods nor the goddesses have yet given it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;Have you ever asked the generous mother for
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, O Chichi San.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why have you not asked your insignificant
father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Chichi San, I feared you would not permit
me to have what I most wished.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her father looked at her gravely and took a
package from his kimono sleeve. He gave it to
Umé, saying as he did so, &quot;Your thoughtful mother
asked me to buy this in the foreign shop and give
it to you this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The package was tied with red and white paper
string. Umé took it in both hands, raised it to her
forehead, bowed her thanks, and opened it. Inside
the package was a pair of red shoes with black heels!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O Chichi San, how worthily beautiful!&quot; and
Umé danced about the room, clasping the pretty
things to her heart. &quot;This is what I have asked of
Benten Sama and Kwannon and of the other
goddesses,&quot; she said with shining eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she stood still and said wonderingly, &quot;But
I did not ask for a baby brother, although he was
more to be desired.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mother gives both the shoes and the baby
brother to you,&quot; said her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I not go to her and give her many thanks
truly?&quot; asked Umé.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;Your mother is ill,&quot; said her father. &quot;It may
be that she will never speak to us again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; cried Umé in great distress. She
looked at the little red shoes and suddenly dropped
them to the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Benten Sama may have them, if she will only
make my honorable mother well,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">The pretty things which she had dreamed of, and
longed for, and begged of all the gods, suddenly
became of no value to her except as an offering to
save her mother's life.</p>

<p class="indent">She knelt at her father's feet and bowed her head
to the floor. &quot;Have I your noble permission to go
to Asakusa Temple and pray to the good Kwannon
that my mother may become well?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; her father answered, &quot;and it may be that
a gift of that which you most treasure will be
pleasing to the Goddess of Mercy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked down at the little red shoes, gathered
them up and tucked them into her kimono sleeve;
then ran to ask old Maru to go with her to the
temple.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl had never before been to the temple
on so sad an errand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See,&quot; said old Maru as the jinrikisha-man took
up his shafts, &quot;the gate-pine-tree is giving you an
honorable message.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé looked back as the old nurse continued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
&quot;When autumn winds blow the leaves from the
other trees and leave them sad and cheerless, the
pine holds its needles more green and vigorous than
ever. We should be like the pine, brave to conquer
our troubles when they come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé tried to smile. &quot;I will be obediently brave,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Maru nodded approvingly. &quot;As the pine
stands for strength and the bamboo for uprightness,
so the fern means hope and the seaweed good
fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Umé began to be a little cheerful. &quot;I dreamed
of Fujiyama, the sacred, in the night,&quot; she said,
&quot;that means great happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said old Maru comfortably, &quot;everything
points to good fortune this morning. Let us hope
that the merciful goddess will be gracious to grant
our prayer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of the temple bells still filled the air.
Everywhere the streets and houses were decorated
with paper lanterns and flags and banners, each
one white with a round red sun. The lanterns
were strung in rows across the streets and on the
houses from the low eaves to the veranda posts.
At the temple they hung at every possible point
from roof to steps.</p>

<p class="indent">Umé and Maru went reverently through all the
ceremony of washing the hands and mouth, ringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
the bell, dropping the offering of coins in the box
and buying the rice-cakes. They left their clogs at
the entrance among several other pairs, for many sad
hearts had come to the temple with petitions on this
early morning of the New Year.</p>

<p class="indent">When Umé left the temple the pretty red shoes
were lying at the feet of the Goddess Kwannon,
and the child's face looked full of hope.</p>

<p class="indent">As they sat in the jinrikisha old Maru said, &quot;One
can never do too much for the honorable mother.&quot;
Then she added proudly, &quot;No other nation in the
world can show such examples of filial love as
Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Umé, who could
listen to a story now that her heart was lightened
of its fear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean the example of the four and twenty
paragons,&quot; replied the nurse. &quot;The gods never
gave me a son. If they had I should have prayed
that he might be like the paragon who, when he
himself was very old, became a baby so that his
parents might not realize how old they had
grown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought we Japanese liked to become very
old,&quot; said Umé, puzzled. &quot;I always say 'Ohayo,
old woman,' to the batter-cake woman at the
corner, and she is gratefully pleased.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true. But the paragon showed his filial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
affection by acting as a baby,&quot; persisted old Maru.
&quot;It was a noble thing to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many paragons were there?&quot; asked Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four and twenty,&quot; replied the old woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was one of them a little girl, and did she give
up her red shoes?&quot; asked Umé.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Maru looked doubtful. &quot;It was a long time
ago,&quot; she said. &quot;I think no red shoes had been
made in the world at that time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé was again thinking of her mother.
&quot;Tell the jinrikisha-man to go faster,&quot; she urged.</p>

<p class="indent">The man was trotting along, looking at every
pine-tree arch. The treeless streets, as far as one
could see, were a bower of pine and bamboo. Little
children ran into the road, dressed in new kimonos
and sashes. Boys were making images of Daruma
Sama in the snow, messengers were bearing gifts
from one house to another, and men dressed in
uniform were already going to pay their respects
to their beloved Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the streets were almost impassable
because of the number of beautifully dressed girls
who were playing battledore and shuttlecock. The
air was full of the bright fluttering toys as they
were struck from one player to the other, and the
silver world was a very merry place as Umé rode
swiftly toward her home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If only the honorable mother is augustly well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
and the new baby strong,&quot; she said wistfully, &quot;our
humble household might be the gayest of them all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As they drew near to their own gateway, Umé
clapped her hands. Tara and his father were in
the garden and an enormous kite was just rising
into the air. It was decorated with a great red
sun and a bright red carp, and had a long tail of red
and blue papers flying behind it. Higher and
higher it rose, the tail turning and twisting in the
wind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know my honorable mother is better!&quot; cried
Umé, beside herself with joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The chestnuts did not go into the lucky-bag for
nothing,&quot; said old Maru contentedly. &quot;I knew they
would bring an answer to our prayer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Umé did not hear her. She left the old
woman picking her way carefully along the snowy
stepping-stones while she flew to her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is my admirable mother better?&quot; she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered her father. &quot;O Doctor San
says she will soon be well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is because the gracious Kwannon was
pleased with the red shoes,&quot; said Umé softly.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
